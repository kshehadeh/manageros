## How to Give Feedback

<Steps>
<Step title="Choose the right moment">

- Give feedback soon after the event or behavior
- Ensure privacy and appropriate setting
- Consider the recipient's readiness to receive feedback

<Tip>
  **Timing matters** Feedback given close to the event is more effective than
  feedback given weeks later. The context is fresh and the behavior is easier to
  recall.
</Tip>

</Step>

<Step title="Be specific and actionable">

- Focus on **observable behaviors** and **specific examples**
- Describe **impact** rather than making judgments
- Suggest **concrete actions** for improvement

**Example of specific feedback:**

- ✅ "In yesterday's standup, you interrupted Sarah twice while she was explaining her blocker."
- ❌ "You need to be a better listener."

</Step>

<Step title="Use the feedback form">

1. Navigate to the person's profile or feedback section
2. Click **Give Feedback**
3. Fill in:
   - **What** – specific situation or behavior
   - **Impact** – how it affected you, the team, or outcomes
   - **Suggestion** – what could be done differently (if constructive)
   - **Context** – link to related initiatives or tasks if relevant

</Step>

<Step title="Choose visibility">

- **Public** – visible to the recipient and organization members
  - Useful for recognition and transparency
  - Can be referenced in performance reviews
- **Private** – only visible to you and the recipient
  - Useful for sensitive or personal development topics
  - Protects privacy while still enabling growth

</Step>
</Steps>

## How to Receive and Use Feedback

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Reviewing feedback">

- Check your feedback regularly
- Look for **patterns** across multiple pieces of feedback
- Separate **observations** from **suggestions**
- Identify **themes** that emerge over time

<Tip>
  **Pattern recognition** When multiple people give similar feedback, it's a
  strong signal that this is an area worth focusing on. Don't dismiss patterns
  as coincidence.
</Tip>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Acting on feedback">

1. **Acknowledge** the feedback and thank the giver
2. **Reflect** on the validity and relevance
3. **Prioritize** which feedback to act on
4. **Create action items** or development goals
5. **Follow up** to show progress

<Check>
  Following up on feedback shows you value the input and are committed to
  growth. This encourages more feedback in the future.
</Check>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Linking to development">

Connect feedback to:

- **Development goals** and objectives
- **1:1 discussions** with your manager
- **Performance reviews** and evaluations

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="For Giving Feedback">

- **Be timely** – give feedback close to when events occur
- **Be specific** – use concrete examples, not generalizations
- **Be balanced** – highlight both strengths and areas for growth
- **Be constructive** – focus on what can be improved, not just what's wrong
- **Be respectful** – consider the recipient's feelings and perspective

<Tip>
  **The feedback sandwich** While not always necessary, starting with something
  positive, then addressing areas for growth, then ending with encouragement can
  make constructive feedback easier to receive.
</Tip>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="For Receiving Feedback">

- **Be open** – approach feedback with curiosity, not defensiveness
- **Ask for clarification** – if feedback is unclear, seek examples
- **Look for patterns** – multiple people saying similar things indicates areas to focus on
- **Take action** – use feedback to inform your development
- **Follow up** – show that you've considered and acted on feedback

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="For Organizations">

- **Create a feedback culture** – encourage regular, constructive feedback
- **Train on feedback** – help people give and receive feedback effectively
- **Make it safe** – ensure feedback is given with good intent and received without retaliation

<Warning>
  **Feedback culture takes time** Building a culture where feedback is freely
  given and received requires consistent modeling from leadership and clear
  expectations about how feedback should be delivered.
