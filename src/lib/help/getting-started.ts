ManagerOS helps managers organize people and teams, run initiatives, manage tasks, hold effective meetings and one‑on‑ones, collect feedback, and integrate with developer tools. This guide orients you to the main concepts and how they relate.

## Core Concepts

- **Organization**: Your top‑level container. All data is isolated per organization.
- **People**: Individual members of your organization. People can belong to teams and have managers.
- **Teams**: Groups of people with a parent/child hierarchy. Teams own initiatives and can be nested.

See more: People & Teams → [People Hierarchy](/people), [Teams](/teams)

## Work Management

- **Initiatives**: Multi‑week efforts that group objectives and tasks. Use initiatives to drive outcomes across teams.
- **Tasks**: Actionable items that can be assigned, prioritized, and tracked. Tasks may belong to initiatives or stand alone.

See more: Tasks & Projects → [Initiatives](/initiatives), [Tasks](/tasks)

## Meetings

- **Meetings**: Scheduled sessions with agendas, notes, and instances. Meetings can recur and generate individual meeting instances.
- **One‑on‑Ones**: Private meetings between a manager and a report. Only participants can view the details.

See more: Meetings & Communication → [Meetings](/meetings), [One‑on‑Ones](/oneonones)

## Feedback & Growth

- **Feedback Campaigns**: Structured requests for feedback about a person. Campaign creators control visibility and collect responses.
- **Responses**: Individual submissions to a campaign. Private feedback is only visible to the author.
- **Synopses**: AI‑generated summaries for a person. Only the person or org admins can access.

See more: Feedback & Development → [Feedback Campaigns](/feedback-campaigns), open a person page to view Feedback & Synopses under People

## Integrations

- **GitHub Integration**: Link accounts to surface PR activity and related context.
- **Jira Integration**: Link accounts to sync assigned tickets and work activity.

See more: Integrations → [GitHub Integration](/settings), [Jira Integration](/settings)

## Entity Links

Attach external links (docs, dashboards, tickets) to people, teams, initiatives, tasks, meetings, and more to centralize context.

See more: Add links via the “Links” section on entity detail pages

## Common Flows

1. Create your organization and invite people
2. Build your team structure
3. Define initiatives and objectives
4. Create and assign tasks
5. Schedule meetings and 1:1s
6. Run a feedback campaign for growth cycles
7. Connect GitHub/Jira for richer context

## Tips

- Look for the small help icon on pages to open targeted help.
- Use the Command Palette (⌘/Ctrl + K) to jump to pages and actions.
- Start with an initiative and link tasks, meetings, and docs for one source of truth.
