<Info>
  The People page is your **source of truth** for who's in your organization, how they're connected, and what they're working on. Think of it as your organization's directory—but way smarter.
</Info>

Ever find yourself asking questions like:
- "Who owns this initiative?"
- "Who does this person report to?"
- "What is this engineer currently involved in?"

The People page is where you'll find those answers, fast.

## What You'll Find Here

The People page shows everyone in your organization in a **searchable, filterable table** that connects to everything else in mpath. It's not just a list—it's your starting point for understanding your team.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Person Profiles" icon="user">
  Each person has a rich profile that brings together their reporting relationships, tasks, initiatives, meetings, feedback, and integrations—all in one place.
</Card>

<Card title="Team & Org Views" icon="users">
  Managers and admins can see both team-level and organization-wide views, giving you the right perspective for any situation.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Why This Matters

You might be wondering: "Why do I need a dedicated People page?" Here's why it's so valuable:

<Tip>
  **Faster answers during reviews and planning**  
  When you're preparing for a performance review or planning session, you can quickly pull up someone's complete context—their workload, recent feedback, and key responsibilities—without jumping between different pages.
</Tip>

- **Clearer ownership and accountability**  
  See who leads what, who reports to whom, and where there might be gaps in your organization structure.

- **Better cross-team collaboration**  
  When initiatives or incidents span multiple teams, you can quickly find the right people across your entire organization.

- **Stronger people decisions**  
  Combine hierarchy, workload, and feedback data to make informed decisions about where to invest your team's time and energy.

## Understanding the People Page

Let's break down what you're looking at:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="The People Table">

The main table shows you at a glance:

- **Name and contact info** - Who they are and how to reach them
- **Role and team** - Where they fit in your organization
- **Status** - Whether they're active, on leave, etc.
- **Quick actions** - Jump to their profile or see them on the org chart

You can sort and filter by team, role, or other attributes, and search by name to jump directly to someone. It's designed to help you find people fast.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Person Profiles">

When you click on someone, you open their profile—and this is where the magic happens. Each profile brings together:

- **Personal info** and contact details
- **Job role** and team assignments
- **Reporting chain** - See their manager and direct reports at a glance
- **Work context** - All their initiatives and tasks in one view
- **Communication** - Meetings (including one-on-ones) and feedback
- **Integrations** - Activity from GitHub, Jira, and other connected tools
- **Synopses** - AI-generated summaries of their work and contributions

Think of it as a dashboard for that person—everything you need to know about them is right there.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The Org Chart">

From the People page, you can jump to the **org chart** (also called the hierarchy view) to visualize your entire organization structure. It transforms your organization into a visual chart that shows:

- **Reporting relationships** - See who reports to whom (manager → direct reports) at a glance
- **Team and org structure** - Understand how teams are organized and connected
- **Navigation paths** - Move up and down the chain to explore relationships

**How to navigate the org chart:**

1. **Start from a known person** - Begin with yourself or your manager
2. **Move up** - See your leadership chain and understand who's above you
3. **Move down** - Explore teams and sub-teams to see the full structure

This is especially helpful in:
- Large organizations where it's hard to keep track of everyone
- Matrixed environments with many teams and cross-functional relationships

<Tip>
  The visual nature of the chart makes it much easier to understand relationships than scrolling through a list. New managers and individual contributors can quickly see "who's who" without digging through scattered docs.
</Tip>

Perfect for understanding relationships, planning organizational changes, and onboarding new team members.

## How to Use It Day-to-Day

Here are the most common ways you'll use the People page:

<Steps>
<Step title="During performance and growth conversations">

Before a review, promotion, or growth conversation, the People page is your prep tool:

1. Open the person's profile from the **People** page
2. Review their complete context:
   - Current initiatives and tasks
   - Recent feedback and synopses
   - Their position in the hierarchy (who they manage, who their peers are)
3. Use this as factual grounding for your discussion

<Check>
  Having concrete data about someone's work and contributions makes these conversations more objective and productive.
</Check>

</Step>

<Step title="When planning staffing and ownership">

Use the People page and org chart together to make smart staffing decisions:

- See who's currently on which team
- Check who owns which initiatives and how stretched they are
- Understand spans of control and team sizes at a glance
- Identify potential successors or co-owners for critical work
- Spot gaps in coverage before they become problems
- See if a manager is overloaded or if a team needs more support

This helps you balance workloads and ensure important work has clear ownership.

</Step>

<Step title="Navigating the org chart">

The org chart (hierarchy view) is perfect for exploring your organization structure:

1. **Start from a known person** - Begin with yourself or your manager
2. **Move up** - See your leadership chain and understand who's above you
3. **Move down** - Explore teams and sub-teams to see the full structure

When working on cross-team initiatives:
- Use the chart to identify managers and leads for involved teams
- Understand who may need to be consulted or informed
- Combine with the People and Initiatives views to see who owns which work and where dependencies live

This helps you map out communication and coordination needs before you start.

</Step>

<Step title="For everyday navigation">

The People page is often the fastest way to find what you need:

- **You remember the person but not the initiative name?** Start with People
- **Want to see all the work and meetings around someone?** Their profile has it all
- **Need to find a manager or teammate quickly?** Search or filter by team

Use filters and search to zero in on exactly the slice of your organization you need.

</Step>

<Step title="As an admin: keeping things accurate">

If you're an admin, the People page is where you maintain your organization's foundation:

- Add new people or bulk-import via CSV
  - Use the **name** column as the key when importing
  - Include only the fields you want to change—blank cells leave existing data in place
  - Import birthdays in `YYYY-MM-DD` format to power upcoming birthday reminders
- Maintain accurate job roles and team assignments
- Keep reporting relationships in sync with reality

<Warning>
  Keeping your org structure accurate is critical. Everything else in mpath—initiatives, tasks, meetings, reports—depends on having the right people in the right places.
</Warning>

</Step>
</Steps>

## Real-World Examples

Let's see how this works in practice:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Preparing for a 1:1">

You have a 1:1 coming up with a direct report. Here's how to prepare:

1. From the People page, open their profile
2. Review their current initiatives and tasks
3. Check for recent feedback or any incidents
4. Use this context to build your 1:1 agenda

<Info>
  For more on running effective 1:1s, check out the one-on-ones guide.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Finding an owner for a new initiative">

You're spinning up a new initiative and need to find the right owner:

1. Filter the People table by team and role
2. Open profiles of potential owners
3. Check what they're already working on
4. Avoid overloading the same person repeatedly

This helps you make informed decisions about who should own new work.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="New manager onboarding">

A new Engineering Manager joins and needs to understand their area quickly:

1. Open the org chart from the People page
2. Navigate to their position in the chart
3. See all their direct and indirect reports at a glance
4. Understand how their area fits into the broader organization

<Info>
  This visual overview is much faster than reading through org docs or asking multiple people. They can see the full picture immediately.
</Info>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Planning a reorganization">

You're considering restructuring your organization. The org chart helps you:

1. **Visualize current structure** - See spans of control and team sizes
2. **Identify potential issues** - Spot managers who might be overloaded or teams that are too small
3. **Simulate changes** - Think through how new structures would look before implementing them

This helps you make data-driven decisions about organizational changes.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Finding the right person for a cross-team initiative">

You're starting a new initiative that needs input from multiple teams:

1. Use the org chart to identify managers and leads for each involved team
2. See how teams connect and who reports to whom
3. Understand communication paths and decision-making structures
4. Identify who needs to be consulted or informed

This ensures you involve the right people from the start.

## Best Practices

Here are some tips to get the most out of the People page:

<Tip>
  **Keep profiles up to date**  
  Make sure titles, teams, and job roles reflect reality. When someone gets promoted or moves teams, update their profile—it affects everything else in mpath.
</Tip>

- **Use consistent naming** for roles and teams. This makes filtering and searching much more effective. Check out the job roles guide for more on this.

- **Rely on filters and search** instead of maintaining separate docs. The People page is your source of truth—use it!

- **Keep the org chart up to date** - Outdated org charts create confusion quickly. When someone moves teams or gets a new manager, update it immediately. Set a reminder to review it quarterly.

- **Review structure periodically** - Set aside time (e.g., quarterly) to review the structure and make sure it still matches how work actually flows. Sometimes the org chart and reality drift apart.

- **Use the org chart for onboarding** - New team members can use the hierarchy to understand the organization quickly. It's a great first stop for anyone joining your team.
