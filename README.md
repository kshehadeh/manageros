# ManagerOS

A comprehensive management platform built for engineering managers to track initiatives, manage people, conduct 1:1s, and monitor team performance through structured check-ins and metrics.

## üöÄ What is ManagerOS?

ManagerOS is a Next.js-based management platform designed specifically for engineering managers. It provides a structured approach to:

- **Initiative Management**: Track strategic initiatives with RAG status, confidence levels, and progress metrics
- **People Management**: Organize team members, roles, and reporting structures
- **1:1 Management**: Schedule and track one-on-one meetings with team members
- **Weekly Check-ins**: Regular progress updates with RAG status and confidence tracking
- **Task Management**: Break down initiatives into objectives and actionable tasks
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitor metrics and outcomes for each initiative

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router and Server Actions
- **Database**: Prisma ORM with SQLite (easily upgradeable to PostgreSQL)
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with shadcn UI components and Radix UI primitives
- **Runtime**: Bun for fast package management and execution
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript throughout the application
- **Validation**: Zod for runtime type validation
- **State Management**: Zustand for client-side caching and global state
- **Caching**: Client-side cache with stale-while-revalidate pattern

## üìã Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed on your system
- Node.js 18+ (if not using Bun)

## üöÄ Local Setup

### 1. Clone and Install Dependencies

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd manageros
bun install
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL="file:./prisma/dev.db"
```

For production, replace with a PostgreSQL connection string:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/manageros"
```

### 3. Database Setup

```bash
# Generate Prisma client
bun run prisma:generate

# Push schema to database
bun run prisma:push

# Seed with sample data
bun run prisma:seed
```

### 4. Start Development Server

```bash
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## üìä Features Overview

### Dashboard

- Recent check-ins with RAG status
- Upcoming 1:1 meetings
- Quick navigation to all sections

### Initiatives Management

- Create and track strategic initiatives
- Set objectives and key results
- Monitor RAG status (Red/Amber/Green) and confidence levels
- Weekly check-ins with progress updates
- Task breakdown and assignment

### People Management

- Team member profiles with roles and contact information
- Organizational hierarchy (manager-reports relationships)
- Team assignments and status tracking

### 1:1 Management

- Schedule recurring one-on-one meetings
- Set agendas and take notes
- Track meeting cadence and history

### Task Management

- Break initiatives into actionable tasks
- Assign tasks to team members
- Track progress with status updates
- Priority and due date management

### Performance Optimization

- **Client-Side Caching**: Zustand-based cache with stale-while-revalidate pattern
- **Network Awareness**: Respects offline state and handles connectivity issues
- **Automatic Cache Invalidation**: Server actions trigger cache refresh
- **Reduced API Calls**: Shared cache eliminates redundant data fetching

### UI Standards

- Standardized UI components:
  - Buttons use the shared shadcn `Button` at `src/components/ui/button.tsx`
  - Default button style is `variant='outline'`
  - Icon-only actions use `size='icon'` and Lucide icons
  - Destructive confirms use `variant='destructive'` only for the confirm state

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

The application uses a comprehensive Prisma schema with the following key models:

- **Team**: Organizational units
- **Person**: Team members with roles and relationships
- **Initiative**: Strategic projects with objectives and metrics
- **Task**: Actionable items linked to initiatives or objectives
- **CheckIn**: Weekly progress updates
- **OneOnOne**: Manager-report meeting records
- **IDP**: Individual Development Plans
- **Feedback**: Peer and manager feedback
- **Metric**: Performance measurements
- **Event**: Audit trail for all activities

## üöÄ Client-Side Caching System

ManagerOS includes a sophisticated client-side caching system built with Zustand that optimizes data fetching and improves user experience:

### Key Features

- **Stale-While-Revalidate**: Shows cached data immediately while refreshing in background
- **Network Awareness**: Respects offline state and handles connectivity issues gracefully
- **Automatic Cache Invalidation**: Server actions trigger cache refresh after mutations
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy to add caching for teams, initiatives, and other entities

### Usage

```tsx
import { usePeopleCache } from '@/hooks/use-organization-cache'

function MyComponent() {
  const { people, isLoading, error } = usePeopleCache()

  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>
  if (error) return <div>Error: {error}</div>

  return (
    <div>
      {people.map(person => (
        <div key={person.id}>{person.name}</div>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## üîß Available Scripts

```bash
# Development
bun run dev          # Start development server
bun run build        # Build for production
bun run start        # Start production server

# Database
bun run prisma:generate  # Generate Prisma client
