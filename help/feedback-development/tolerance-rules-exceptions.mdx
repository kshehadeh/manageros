<Info>
  Tolerance rules help you **monitor organizational health** by automatically
  tracking key metrics and alerting you when thresholds are exceeded. Think of
  them as automated health checks for your team.
</Info>

Tolerance rules monitor important organizational practices like one-on-one frequency, initiative check-ins, feedback cycles, and management span. When a threshold is exceeded, the system creates an **exception** and sends a **notification** to alert you.

## What Are Tolerance Rules?

Tolerance rules are configurable monitors that track specific organizational metrics. They run automatically every day and create exceptions when something needs attention.

## Available Rule Types

### 1:1 Frequency

Monitors whether managers are having regular one-on-one meetings with their direct reports.

**What it checks:**

- Finds the most recent one-on-one meeting between each manager and their direct reports
- Calculates how many days have passed since the last meeting
- Creates exceptions if too much time has passed

**Configuration:**

- **Warning Threshold**: Days before creating a warning exception
- **Urgent Threshold**: Days before creating an urgent exception

**Example:**
If you set warning at 14 days and urgent at 21 days:

- A manager who hasn't met with a report in 15 days gets a **warning** exception
- A manager who hasn't met with a report in 22 days gets an **urgent** exception

<Tip>
  **Best Practice**: Set warning threshold to your target 1:1 frequency (e.g.,
  weekly = 7 days), and urgent to 2x that (e.g., 14 days).
</Tip>

### Initiative Check-In

Monitors whether active initiatives have had recent check-ins.

**What it checks:**

- Finds all active initiatives (planned or in progress)
- Looks for the most recent check-in date
- Creates exceptions if too much time has passed since the last check-in

**Configuration:**

- **Warning Threshold**: Days since last check-in before creating a warning

**Example:**
If you set warning at 7 days:

- An initiative that hasn't had a check-in in 8 days gets a **warning** exception
- If an initiative has never had a check-in, it immediately exceeds the threshold

### 360 Feedback

Monitors whether people have received 360 feedback within a specified time period.

**What it checks:**

- Finds all active people in your organization
- Looks for the most recent feedback campaign where they were the target
- Creates exceptions if too much time has passed since last feedback

**Configuration:**

- **Warning Threshold**: Months since last feedback before creating a warning

**Example:**
If you set warning at 6 months:

- A person who hasn't received feedback in 7 months gets a **warning** exception
- If someone has never received feedback, it immediately exceeds the threshold

### Manager Span

Monitors whether managers have too many direct reports.

**What it checks:**

- Counts active direct reports for each manager
- Creates exceptions if a manager exceeds the maximum

**Configuration:**

- **Max Direct Reports**: Maximum number of direct reports allowed

**Example:**
If you set max at 8:

- A manager with 9 direct reports gets an **urgent** exception
- This helps identify when managers might be overloaded

## Understanding Exceptions

When a tolerance rule threshold is exceeded, the system creates an **exception**. Exceptions are records that track what needs attention.

### Exception Severity

- **Warning**: Something to be aware of, but not immediately critical
- **Urgent**: Requires prompt attention

### Exception Status

Exceptions move through different statuses:

1. **Active**: Newly created, needs attention
2. **Acknowledged**: You've seen it and are aware
3. **Ignored**: Intentionally not acting on it
4. **Resolved**: The underlying issue has been fixed

### Working with Exceptions

When you receive a notification about an exception:

1. **Review the details** - Click through to see what needs attention
2. **Take action** - Address the underlying issue (e.g., schedule a 1:1, do a check-in)
3. **Update status** - Acknowledge, ignore, or resolve the exception

<Tip>
  **Resolve exceptions when fixed**: When you've addressed the underlying issue
  (e.g., had the 1:1, did the check-in), mark the exception as resolved. This
  helps track that issues are being addressed.
</Tip>

## Notifications

When an exception is created, you automatically receive a **notification**:

- **Type**: Warning or error (based on exception severity)
- **Content**: Clear message about what needs attention
- **Link**: Direct link to view the exception details

Notifications appear in:

- Your notification bell icon
- The notifications page
- Exception-specific views

## Managing Tolerance Rules

### Creating Rules

Only organization administrators can create tolerance rules:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Tolerance Rules**
2. Click **Create Rule**
3. Select the rule type
4. Configure thresholds
5. Give it a descriptive name and optional description
6. Enable the rule

### Configuring Rules

Each rule type has specific configuration options:

- **1:1 Frequency**: Warning and urgent day thresholds
- **Initiative Check-In**: Warning day threshold
- **360 Feedback**: Warning month threshold
- **Manager Span**: Maximum direct reports

<Warning>
  **Start conservative**: Begin with longer thresholds and adjust based on your
  actual patterns. You can always make them stricter later.
</Warning>

### Enabling and Disabling

You can enable or disable rules without deleting them:

- **Enabled**: Rule is evaluated daily and creates exceptions
- **Disabled**: Rule is not evaluated (existing exceptions remain)

This is useful for:

- Temporarily pausing a rule
- Testing different threshold values
- Seasonal adjustments

### Manual Evaluation

You can manually trigger a tolerance check at any time:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Tolerance Rules**
2. Click **Run Check Now**
3. The system evaluates all enabled rules immediately
4. You'll see a summary of exceptions created

This is useful for:

- Testing new rules
- Checking status after making changes
- Immediate evaluation without waiting for the daily run

## Best Practices

### Rule Configuration

- **Use descriptive names**: Make it clear what each rule monitors
- **Add descriptions**: Explain why the rule exists and what it's checking
- **Start with longer thresholds**: You can always make them stricter
- **Review regularly**: Adjust thresholds based on actual patterns

### Exception Management

- **Review active exceptions regularly**: Don't let them pile up
- **Prioritize urgent exceptions**: Address these promptly
- **Resolve when fixed**: Mark exceptions as resolved when you've addressed the issue
- **Ignore appropriately**: Use ignore for exceptions that are intentional or no longer relevant

### Team Communication

- **Share rule purposes**: Help your team understand why rules exist
- **Set expectations**: Let people know they may receive exception notifications
- **Use as coaching tools**: Exceptions can help identify areas for improvement

## Common Scenarios

### Setting Up 1:1 Monitoring

**Goal**: Ensure managers have weekly 1:1s with their direct reports

**Configuration:**

- Warning threshold: 7 days
- Urgent threshold: 14 days

**Result**: Managers get warnings if they miss a week, urgent if they miss two weeks.

### Monitoring Initiative Health

**Goal**: Ensure active initiatives have regular check-ins

**Configuration:**

- Warning threshold: 7 days

**Result**: Initiatives without check-ins for a week get warnings.

### Tracking Feedback Cycles

**Goal**: Ensure everyone receives 360 feedback at least every 6 months

**Configuration:**

- Warning threshold: 6 months

**Result**: People who haven't received feedback in 6+ months get warnings.

### Managing Manager Span

**Goal**: Ensure no manager has more than 8 direct reports

**Configuration:**

- Max direct reports: 8

**Result**: Managers with 9+ direct reports get urgent exceptions.

## Troubleshooting

### Exceptions Not Appearing

- Check that the rule is **enabled**
- Verify the **threshold values** are correct
- Wait for the daily evaluation (or run manually)
- Check that the underlying data exists (e.g., people, initiatives)

### Too Many Exceptions

- Review threshold values - they may be too strict
- Consider disabling rules that are no longer relevant
- Resolve or ignore exceptions that are no longer actionable

### Not Receiving Notifications

- Check your notification preferences
- Verify you have access to view exceptions
- Check that notifications aren't being filtered
