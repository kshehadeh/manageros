# APIs

## General Rules

* When creating or updating an API, update the documentation in the docs/api directory.
* Prefer API routes over server actions especially when just reading data.
* Use server actions in cases where you need to perform a mutation or write data to the database especially in cases where the work is being done in a React Server Component in some cases.
