Direct reports are the people who **report directly to you**. The Direct Reports view in mpath gives you a focused lens on **how your team is doing and what they need from you**.

---

## Overview

The Direct Reports view pulls together:

- Who your direct reports are
- Their **recent work** (initiatives, tasks)
- Their **meetings** (especially one‑on‑ones)
- Signals like feedback, synopses, and activity

Use it as your **home base for people management**.

---

## Why the Direct Reports View Matters (Benefits)

- **Clear picture of your team’s load and focus**  
  See where people are heavily loaded or under‑utilized.

- **Better coaching and support**  
  Quickly jump from a person to their initiatives, tasks, and 1:1s.

- **Faster detection of risk**  
  Spot patterns like repeated blockers, dropped work, or missing 1:1s.

- **Stronger career conversations**  
  Have discussions anchored in real work and history, not just memory.

## Key Concepts

### Team composition

See:

- How many people report to you
- Their roles, levels, and teams
- Changes over time (e.g. reorgs, new hires)

### Work and outcomes

For each report you can navigate to:

- **Initiatives** they own or contribute to
- **Tasks** they’re working on (with status and priority)
- **Meetings** they’re regularly part of

### Growth and feedback signals

Tie in:

- **Feedback** they have received (and sometimes given)
- **Synopses** or reports that summarize their impact
- Notes from **one‑on‑ones** over time

## How to Use Direct Reports in Your Weekly Rhythm

### 1. Before 1:1s

Use the Direct Reports view to:

- Scan each person’s current work and initiatives.
- Note any:
  - Overloaded or under‑loaded engineers
  - Repeated blockers or dropped tasks
  - Big wins to recognize

This becomes input into your \`one-on-ones\` agendas.

### 2. During team health reviews

On a weekly or bi‑weekly basis:

- Look across your direct reports:
  - Who is carrying the most critical initiatives?
  - Who might be ready for more ownership?
  - Who appears consistently blocked or stuck?
- Use this to:
  - Adjust staffing on initiatives
  - Plan growth opportunities
  - Decide where you need to lean in as a manager

### 3. For performance and promotion discussions

When evaluating performance:

- Start from Direct Reports → individual profiles.
- Review:
  - Ownership and results on initiatives
  - Consistency of delivery on tasks
  - Feedback patterns and synopses
- Build a balanced picture anchored in evidence.

## Examples & Best Practices

### Example: Adjusting load across the team

- You notice one engineer is on **several High priority initiatives**, while another has mostly Low/Medium tasks.
- Use Direct Reports + People to:
  - Rebalance work across initiatives.
  - Move ownership where appropriate.

### Example: Preparing for calibration

- Use the view to:
  - List your direct reports and their key outcomes this cycle.
  - Identify which examples to bring into calibration or performance forums.

### Quick best practices

- **Review this view at least weekly** – don’t wait for performance review season.
- **Use it alongside 1:1s** – what you see here should inform your conversations.
- **Track patterns over time**, not just snapshots – trends matter more than single weeks.
