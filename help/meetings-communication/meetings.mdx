<Info>
  Meetings in mpath give you a **single place to plan, run, and connect discussions to real work** – without losing context in scattered calendars and docs.
</Info>

mpath separates **meetings** (the series or one‑time event) from **meeting instances** (each actual occurrence). Understanding the difference helps you design effective rhythms instead of "just more meetings."

## Overview: Meetings vs Meeting Instances

- A **meeting** defines:
  - The purpose and structure (title, description, agenda)
  - The base schedule (date/time and recurrence pattern)
  - Default participants and a meeting owner
  - Associations to teams, initiatives, and objectives

- A **meeting instance** is:
  - One specific occurrence on a particular date
  - Where you capture **notes, attendance, and action items**
  - Independently reschedulable or cancelable

Think of it as:

- **Meeting** → "Our weekly platform sync, every Monday at 10:00."
- **Instance** → "This Monday's platform sync, where we discussed Q3 incidents."

## Why This Model Matters

<Tip>
  **Cleaner calendars and history**  
  Change details for a single occurrence without breaking the whole series.
</Tip>

- **Better decision tracking**  
  Each instance holds the specific decisions and actions from that session.

- **Clear ownership and expectations**  
  The series defines who should generally be there; instances record who actually was.

- **Stronger connection to work**  
  Meetings tie directly into initiatives and tasks, so discussions drive execution.

## Types of Meetings

### One-Time Meetings

Use one‑time meetings for:

- Ad‑hoc discussions and incident reviews
- Interviews, performance conversations, or special workshops
- One‑off deep dives with stakeholders

These are simple: one schedule, one occurrence, individual notes and tasks.

**Features:**
- Single occurrence with specific date and time
- Direct scheduling without recurrence patterns
- Simple participant management and status tracking
- Individual notes and follow-up actions

### Recurring Meetings

Use recurring meetings for:

- Weekly team syncs
- Bi‑weekly planning or grooming
- Monthly initiative reviews or leadership check‑ins

You define:

- **Pattern** – daily, weekly, monthly, bi‑monthly, semi‑annually
- **Participants** – who is expected each time
- **Associations** – which teams/initiatives this ritual supports

mpath generates instances automatically based on this pattern.

**Features:**
- Series of meetings with consistent participants and agenda
- Multiple recurrence patterns: daily, weekly, monthly, bi-monthly, semi-annually
- Automatic instance generation based on pattern
- Consistent structure across all instances

## Creating Meetings

### Basic Information

When creating a meeting, you'll set:

- **Title** - Clear, descriptive meeting name
- **Description** - Meeting purpose and agenda
- **Date and time** - Scheduled start time
- **Duration** - Meeting length in minutes
- **Location** - Physical or virtual meeting space

### Participants

- **Add team members** from your organization
- **Set initial status** (invited, accepted, declined, tentative)
- **Include external participants** via email
- **Assign meeting owner** for responsibility

### Associations

- **Link to teams** for team-specific meetings
- **Connect to initiatives** for project meetings
- **Associate with objectives** for goal-focused sessions
- **Add meeting notes** for context and preparation

### Step-by-Step: Create a Meeting

1. Go to the **Meetings** area.
2. Click **New meeting**.
3. Fill out the basics:
   - **Title** – clear and descriptive (e.g. "Weekly Product–Eng Sync")
   - **Description** – purpose, agenda, or context
   - **Date & time** – when the first session happens
   - **Duration** – in minutes
   - **Location** – video link or room
4. Add participants from your organization (and external guests if needed).
5. Set the **meeting owner** – the person responsible for the session.

### Make it Recurring (if applicable)

1. Enable **recurrence** if this is a recurring meeting.
2. Choose a pattern (e.g. weekly) and **start/end dates**.
3. Save – mpath will generate **meeting instances** for each occurrence.

### Connect Meetings to Real Work

1. From the meeting page, **associate**:
   - Relevant **teams**
   - **Initiatives** and **objectives** being discussed
2. Use these associations to:
   - Jump from a meeting to the initiative it supports
   - Quickly find all meetings linked to a strategic effort

## Meeting Instances

Meeting instances are the **actual occurrences on your calendar** – the individual sessions created from a recurring meeting. This is where you track **what really happened**: who attended, what you decided, and which action items were created.

### Why Meeting Instances Matter

- **Accurate history of conversations and decisions**  
  Each instance keeps its own notes and attendance.

- **Flexible scheduling without chaos**  
  You can move or cancel a single occurrence without changing the whole series.

- **Clear follow‑through**  
  Action items from a given instance can be tracked as tasks linked back for context.

- **Better reviews and retros**  
  Looking across instances shows how a team or initiative has evolved over time.

### Instance Management

- **Individual instances** for each occurrence of recurring meetings
- **Instance-specific notes** and updates
- **Participant status tracking** per instance
- **Attendance recording** (attended, absent, excused)

### Instance Features

- **Flexible scheduling** - Modify individual instance times
- **Instance-specific notes** - Capture unique discussion points
- **Participant management** - Add/remove participants per instance
- **Status updates** - Track attendance and participation

### Instance Statuses

- **Invited** - Participant has been invited
- **Accepted** - Participant confirmed attendance
- **Declined** - Participant cannot attend
- **Tentative** - Participant unsure about attendance
- **Attended** - Participant was present
- **Absent** - Participant did not attend

### How to Work with Instances

#### 1. Adjust a Single Occurrence

Use this when **one meeting in a series** needs to move:

1. Open the **specific meeting instance**.
2. Update the **date/time** or **location** as needed.
3. Optionally adjust participants (e.g. add a guest for this session only).
4. Save – only this instance is affected.

<Tip>
  If your entire cadence is shifting, update the **meeting series**, not each instance individually.
</Tip>

#### 2. Capture Notes and Decisions

During or after the meeting:

1. Open the instance and add **notes**:
   - Key discussion points
   - Decisions and rationale
   - Risks or open questions
2. Highlight action items clearly so they can be turned into tasks.

#### 3. Track Attendance and Participation

1. After the session, update:
   - Participant **status** if it changed
   - **Attendance** (`attended`, `absent`, `excused`) for each person
2. Use this history to:
   - Understand who regularly attends key rituals
   - Spot patterns (e.g. frequent no‑shows)

#### 4. Create Tasks from Action Items

1. From the instance notes, create **tasks** for follow‑ups.
2. Link tasks back to:
   - The **meeting instance** (for context)
   - The relevant **initiative** or **objective** where the work belongs
3. Review these tasks in future instances to close the loop.

## Meeting Workflow

### Planning Phase

1. **Create meeting** with basic information
2. **Add participants** and set initial statuses
3. **Set recurrence pattern** if applicable
4. **Add notes** and preparation materials

### Execution Phase

1. **Send invitations** to participants
2. **Track responses** and update statuses
3. **Hold meeting** and record attendance
4. **Add instance notes** and follow-up items

### Follow-up Phase

1. **Review meeting outcomes** and decisions
2. **Create action items** and assign responsibilities
3. **Schedule follow-up meetings** if needed
4. **Update recurring series** based on feedback

## Examples & Best Practices

### Example: Weekly Team Sync

- **Meeting (series)**:
  - Weekly, 45 minutes, same participants and agenda.
  - Linked to the team and its key initiatives.
- **Instances**:
  - Each one tracks:
    - What changed on initiatives (RAG, confidence, key risks)
    - Which tasks were created or closed
    - Who attended and who missed

### Example: Monthly Stakeholder Review

- **Meeting (series)**:
  - Monthly review with engineering, product, and leadership.
  - Linked to cross‑team initiatives and objectives.
- **Instances**:
  - Capture decisions on scope, priority shifts, and risks.
  - Spawn tasks for follow‑ups and communication work.

### Example: Skipping a Holiday

- You have a weekly "Platform Sync" on Mondays.
- One Monday lands on a holiday.
- Instead of editing the whole series:
  - Open that instance and **cancel** or move just that occurrence.

### Example: Special Guest Review

- A quarterly planning instance includes a VP or stakeholder.
- For that instance only:
  - Add the stakeholder as a participant.
  - Tailor the notes and agenda to planning outcomes.

### Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Define meetings around decisions, not just updates.**  
  Every recurring meeting should clearly state what it is accountable for.
</Tip>

**Meeting Planning:**
- **Set clear objectives** for each meeting
- **Prepare agenda** and share in advance
- **Choose appropriate duration** based on content
- **Select optimal timing** for all participants
- **Keep meetings scoped** – each meeting should have a clear purpose and owner
- **Default to shorter durations** – extend only when it consistently feels too tight

**Participant Management:**
- **Invite relevant stakeholders** only
- **Set realistic expectations** for attendance
- **Provide context** in meeting descriptions
- **Respect time zones** for distributed teams
- **Invite only necessary participants** – avoid bloated meetings when a smaller group would do

**Recurring Meetings:**
- **Establish consistent schedule** and format
- **Review series regularly** for relevance
- **Adjust frequency** based on team needs
- **Cancel or modify** when no longer needed
- **Review recurring meetings quarterly** – kill or reshape meetings that no longer provide clear value

**Documentation:**
- **Take comprehensive notes** during meetings
- **Record decisions** and action items clearly
- **Follow up** on commitments and deadlines
- **Archive completed** meeting instances
- **Keep instance notes focused on decisions and actions**, not full transcripts
- **Record attendance promptly** after each session
- **Cancel instances that are no longer needed** to keep schedules clean
- Use instances as the **source of truth** when you need to remember "What did we decide last time?"
