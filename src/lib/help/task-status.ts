Task status helps you track the progress of work items through their lifecycle. ManagerOS uses a simple but effective status system:

## Status Types

### üìã To Do

- **New tasks** that haven't been started yet
- **Future work** planned but not yet in progress
- **Ideas and concepts** that need further definition
- **Default status** for newly created tasks

### üîÑ Doing

- **Active work** currently being completed
- **Tasks being worked on** by team members
- **Items in development** or implementation phase
- **Work in progress** that requires attention

### ‚è∏Ô∏è Blocked

- **Tasks waiting** for external dependencies
- **Work stalled** due to obstacles or issues
- **Items requiring** additional information or resources
- **Impediments** that prevent progress

### ‚úÖ Done

- **Completed tasks** that have been finished
- **Work items** ready for review or deployment
- **Deliverables** that meet acceptance criteria
- **Successfully completed** work

### üóëÔ∏è Dropped

- **Cancelled tasks** that are no longer needed
- **Work items** that became obsolete
- **Tasks abandoned** due to changing priorities
- **Non-essential items** removed from scope

## Best Practices

- **Update status regularly** as work progresses
- **Use "Blocked" status** when dependencies prevent progress
- **Move to "Done"** only when work is truly complete
- **Use "Dropped"** for cancelled or obsolete tasks
- **Review "To Do"** regularly to prioritize next steps

## Workflow Tips

- **Start with "To Do"** for new tasks
- **Move to "Doing"** when work begins
- **Set to "Blocked"** if obstacles arise
- **Mark as "Done"** when work is complete
- **Use "Dropped"** for cancelled work
