One‑on‑ones are your **most important recurring meeting** as a manager. They’re where coaching, trust, and early risk detection actually happen.

Handled well, they keep people engaged, aligned, and growing – not just “status updates”.

---

## Why One‑on‑Ones Matter (Benefits)

### For managers

- **Stay close to reality**  
  Hear about risks, blockers, and morale before they show up in metrics.

- **Coach, don’t just assign**  
  Use the time to build judgment and autonomy, not to re‑do sprint planning.

- **Build trust and retention**  
  Consistent, high‑quality 1:1s are one of the strongest predictors of engagement.

### For team members

- **Dedicated space for them**  
  Time to talk about career, concerns, and ideas that don’t fit into standups.

- **Clear priorities and expectations**  
  Align on what “good” looks like this week/quarter.

- **Regular feedback loop**  
  Both to receive coaching and to give feedback upward.

mpath makes 1:1s easier to run consistently and ties them into the rest of the system (people, tasks, feedback, initiatives).

## Key Concepts

### One‑on‑one record

A 1:1 in mpath represents the **relationship and cadence** between a manager and a report:

- Who the manager and report are
- How often you meet (weekly, bi‑weekly, monthly, etc.)
- The history of notes, commitments, and topics

### Notes and action items

- Use notes to capture:
  - Themes over time (career goals, growth areas, strengths)
  - Specific commitments from each side
  - Follow‑ups for the next session
- Turn action items into **tasks** when they should appear in the day‑to‑day workflow.

### Links to other data

From a 1:1 you can quickly access:

- The person’s **tasks**, **initiatives**, and **meetings**
- **Feedback** and **synopses** (where appropriate)
- Their place in the **people hierarchy**

This pulls everything into a single, coaching‑focused conversation.

## How to Run Effective One‑on‑Ones in mpath

### 1. Set up the relationship

1. Ensure the **manager ↔ report** relationship is correct in the people/teams setup.
2. Configure the **cadence** you want:
   - Weekly or bi‑weekly for most engineers
   - Monthly for senior ICs or leads who also meet in group forums
3. Make sure both sides know:
   - When the meeting is
   - What it’s for
   - How to add topics

### 2. Prepare for the session

Before each 1:1, quickly review:

- The person’s **recent tasks** (especially blocked or high‑priority items)
- Any active **initiatives** they own or contribute to
- Recent **feedback** or report **synopses**

Skim previous 1:1 notes for:

- Open commitments
- Themes you’re tracking (growth areas, stressors, goals)

### 3. Structure the conversation

Use a simple flow:

1. **Their topics first**
   - “What’s top of mind for you this week?”
2. **Work and execution**
   - Progress, blockers, support needed
   - How current work ties back to initiatives and goals
3. **Career and growth**
   - Skills to develop, opportunities, next steps
4. **Feedback both ways**
   - What’s working / not working in your partnership

Capture key points and decisions in the 1:1 notes.

### 4. Turn talk into follow‑through

At the end of the meeting:

- Summarize **3–5 concrete commitments**:
  - What they will do
  - What you will do
  - By when
- Create **tasks** for items that need to show up in execution:
  - Link them to the person and any relevant initiatives.
- At the next 1:1, start by reviewing how these commitments went.

## Examples & Best Practices

### Example: Early‑career engineer

- Cadence: Weekly 30 minutes
- Focus:
  - Clarifying priorities for the week
  - Unblocking tasks and pairing opportunities
  - Building confidence and communication patterns
- In mpath:
  - Review their tasks (status + priority).
  - Use initiatives to show how their work fits into bigger goals.
  - Capture growth areas and wins in the notes.

### Example: Senior IC or tech lead

- Cadence: Bi‑weekly or monthly, longer when needed
- Focus:
  - Initiative ownership and strategic impact
  - Cross‑team collaboration and influence
  - Long‑term career direction
- In mpath:
  - Use initiative pages as anchor material.
  - Connect 1:1 topics to feedback and reports.

### General best practices

- **Protect the time** – cancel only when absolutely necessary, and reschedule quickly.
- **Avoid turning 1:1s into status meetings only** – status is a starting point, not the whole agenda.
- **Write down commitments** – future you (and they) will thank you.
- **Use the system, not separate docs** – keep notes, tasks, and initiatives connected so 1:1s are grounded in reality, not memory.
