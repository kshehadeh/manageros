Integrations connect **third-party tools and services** to mpath, bringing external work activity and context directly into your management workflows.

Instead of switching between multiple tools, integrations help you see **where work is happening** across your organization—from code contributions to ticket assignments—all in one place.

---

## What Integrations Do

Integrations help you:

- **See complete work context** for team members by combining mpath tasks with external activity
- **Reduce context switching** by bringing Jira tickets, GitHub pull requests, and other work into mpath
- **Get better insights** for performance reviews, planning, and team discussions
- **Understand work distribution** across different tools and platforms

The goal is not to replace your existing tools, but to **enrich the workflows you already use** with additional context and visibility.

## How to Access Integration Data

### Activity Views

Integration data appears in **Activity views** for each person:

1. Navigate to a person's profile
2. Click the **"View"** dropdown menu
3. Select **"Activity"**

The Activity view shows:

- **Tasks** from mpath
- **Initiatives** the person is working on
- **Jira metrics** (if Jira account is linked)
  - Assigned issues
  - Issue progress and status
  - Project activity
- **GitHub metrics** (if GitHub account is linked)
  - Recent pull requests
  - Code contributions
  - Repository activity

<Info>
  Activity views use date ranges to filter data. Adjust the date range to see
  activity for specific time periods.
</Info>

### AI Overview and Synopses

Integration data also appears in:

- **AI Overview** reports for people
- **AI-generated synopses** that synthesize work across all tools
- **Initiative views** that show how work spans multiple platforms

This helps you get a **complete picture** of someone's contributions across mpath, Jira, GitHub, and other connected tools.

## Account Linking

To see integration data for a person, you need to **link their account** in the third-party system to their mpath person record.

### How Account Linking Works

Account linking creates a connection between:

- A **person** in mpath (someone in your organization)
- An **account** in a third-party system (their Jira user, GitHub profile, etc.)

Once linked, mpath can:

- Fetch activity data from the third-party system
- Attribute work to the correct person
- Display metrics and activity in Activity views

### Linking Accounts

#### For Jira

1. Open the person's profile in mpath
2. Go to the **"Account Linking"** section
3. Enter the person's **Jira email address**
4. Click **"Link Account"**

<Check>
  Your organization must have Jira integration configured at the organization
  level before you can link individual accounts.
</Check>

#### For GitHub

1. Open the person's profile in mpath
2. Go to the **"Account Linking"** section
3. Enter the person's **GitHub username**
4. Click **"Link Account"**

<Check>
  Your organization must have GitHub integration configured at the organization
  level before you can link individual accounts.
</Check>

### Requirements

Before linking accounts:

1. **Organization-level integration** must be configured
   - Go to **Organization Settings → Integrations**
   - Click **Add Integration** and select Jira or GitHub
   - Configure with appropriate credentials
   - Test the connection

2. **Person must exist** in mpath
   - Create the person record if it doesn't exist
   - Ensure they belong to your organization

3. **Account must exist** in the third-party system
   - For Jira: The email must match an active Jira user
   - For GitHub: The username must be valid

### Unlinking Accounts

To remove an account link:

1. Go to the person's profile
2. Navigate to **"Account Linking"**
3. Click **"Unlink"** next to the account you want to remove

<Warning>
  Unlinking an account will stop fetching new activity data, but historical data
  may still be visible in reports and synopses.
</Warning>

## Setting Up Integrations

### Organization-Level Setup

Before linking individual accounts, administrators must configure integrations at the organization level:

1. Go to **Organization Settings → Integrations**
2. Click **Add Integration**
3. Select the integration you want to set up (Jira or GitHub)
4. Enter required credentials:
   - **Jira**: Name, Jira base URL, username/email, and API token
   - **GitHub**: Name, GitHub username, and Personal Access Token (PAT)
5. Click **Create** (the system will test the connection automatically)

<Info>
  Use the minimum required scopes for tokens and rotate them regularly for
  security.
</Info>

### Individual Account Linking

Once organization-level integration is configured:

1. Navigate to a person's profile
2. Use the **"Account Linking"** section to link their accounts
3. Verify the link appears correctly
4. Check the Activity view to confirm data is being fetched

---

## Best Practices

### Security

- **Use fine-grained tokens** where possible (especially for GitHub)
- **Rotate credentials regularly** and remove unused tokens
- **Limit token scopes** to only what's needed
- **Review linked accounts** periodically and unlink when people leave

### Data Management

- **Link accounts promptly** for new team members
- **Verify account links** are correct (wrong links show wrong data)
- **Keep links current** as people change roles or accounts
- **Review integration data** regularly to ensure accuracy

### Usage

- **Use Activity views** for quick checks on recent work
- **Combine with AI Overview** for comprehensive insights
- **Don't rely solely on metrics**—use integration data as one input among many
- **Respect privacy**—integration data should support, not replace, conversations

---

## Troubleshooting

### No Data Appearing

If integration data isn't showing up:

1. **Check organization-level configuration**
   - Verify integration is enabled in Settings
   - Test the connection
   - Confirm credentials are valid

2. **Verify account linking**
   - Ensure the person's account is linked
   - Check that the email/username is correct
   - Confirm the account exists in the third-party system

3. **Check date ranges**
   - Activity views use date ranges—ensure your range includes recent activity
   - Try expanding the date range

4. **Review permissions**
   - Verify the integration credentials have access to the data
   - Check repository/project permissions for GitHub/Jira

### Wrong Data Showing

If you see incorrect data:

1. **Verify account linking**
   - Check that the linked account belongs to the correct person
   - Unlink and re-link if necessary

2. **Check for duplicate accounts**
   - Some systems may have multiple accounts for the same person
   - Ensure you're linking to the correct account
