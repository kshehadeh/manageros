<Info>
  The onboarding system helps new team members become effective quickly through structured, trackable onboarding journeys. Create reusable templates, assign them to people, and track progress as they complete each step.
</Info>

Onboarding in mpath provides a systematic way to ensure new team members get up to speed with the right information, connections, and context. Instead of ad-hoc onboarding, you can create templates once and use them for many people.

## Overview

The onboarding system consists of:

## Key Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Onboarding Templates">

A **template** is a reusable definition of what onboarding looks like for a role or team:

- **Name and description** - Identifies the template and its purpose
- **Scope** - Optional team and/or job role association
- **Phases** - Ordered groupings of items (e.g., "Day 1", "Week 1", "First 30 Days")
- **Active status** - Whether the template can be assigned

Templates can be marked as the **organization default**, which makes them the fallback when no specific team/role match is found.

<Tip>
  Create templates that match your actual onboarding process. Start with your most common onboarding path, then create variations for different roles or teams.
</Tip>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Onboarding Phases">

**Phases** organize items into logical time periods:

- Each phase has a name (e.g., "Day 1", "Week 1", "First 30 Days")
- Phases are ordered—items in earlier phases should be completed before later ones
- Phases help onboardees understand what to focus on when

<Info>
  Phases are organizational tools. They don't enforce timing—you can complete items from multiple phases if needed. But they help structure the journey.
</Info>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Onboarding Items">

**Items** are the atomic steps within a phase. Each item has a type:

| Type | Description | Who Completes |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| **TASK** | Something to do | Onboardee |
| **READING** | Documentation to read | Onboardee |
| **MEETING** | Conversation to have | Either |
| **CHECKPOINT** | Verification point | Manager/Mentor only |
| **EXPECTATION** | Context to understand | Onboardee |

Items can:
- Link to external URLs for resources and documentation
- Be marked as **required** or **optional**
- Have descriptions explaining what needs to be done

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Onboarding Instances">

An **instance** is a live onboarding assigned to a specific person:

- References a template
- Tracks the onboardee (person)
- Has an assigned manager and optional mentor
- Contains progress records for each item

Each person can have one active instance per template. This prevents duplicate onboarding assignments.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Progress Tracking">

Each item in an instance has a **progress status**:

- **PENDING** - Not yet started
- **IN_PROGRESS** - Work has begun
- **COMPLETED** - Marked as done
- **SKIPPED** - Deliberately skipped (optional items)
- **BLOCKED** - Cannot proceed

Progress is tracked at the item, phase, and instance level, giving you visibility into where people are in their onboarding journey.

## How to Use Onboarding

<Steps>
<Step title="Create an onboarding template (Admin)">

1. Navigate to **Organization Settings → Onboarding Templates**
2. Click **New Template**
3. Enter template name and description
4. Optionally select a team and/or job role to scope the template
5. Mark as organization default if it should be the fallback
6. Add phases with descriptive names (e.g., "Day 1", "Week 1")
7. Add items to each phase:
   - Set the item type (TASK, READING, MEETING, CHECKPOINT, EXPECTATION)
   - Mark as required or optional
   - Add description and optional links
8. Save the template

<Tip>
  Start with your most common onboarding path. You can always create variations later for different roles or teams.
</Tip>

</Step>

<Step title="Assign onboarding to a person (Manager)">

1. Go to a person's profile page
2. Open the actions dropdown
3. Click **Start Onboarding**
4. Select a template (smart suggestions based on team/role)
5. Optionally assign a mentor
6. Confirm to create the onboarding instance

<Info>
  The system will suggest templates based on the person's team and job role. If no match is found, it will suggest the organization default template.
</Info>

</Step>

<Step title="Complete onboarding items (Onboardee)">

1. View the onboarding widget on your dashboard
2. Click to access the full onboarding page at `/onboarding`
3. Expand each phase to see items
4. Complete items by clicking the checkmark
5. Add optional notes to completed items
6. For CHECKPOINT items, wait for manager/mentor approval

<Check>
  Most items can be completed by the onboardee. CHECKPOINT items require manager or mentor confirmation to ensure quality.
</Check>

</Step>

<Step title="Manager oversight">

Managers can track their team's onboarding progress:

1. View team onboarding status in the dashboard section
2. Navigate to **Onboarding → Overview** for detailed view
3. See progress percentages and stuck indicators
4. Complete checkpoint items for team members
5. Mark onboarding as complete when all required items are done

<Warning>
  Only managers and admins can mark onboarding as complete. This ensures quality and prevents premature completion.
</Warning>

</Step>
</Steps>

## Completion Logic

### Item Completion

- Most items can be completed by the onboardee
- **CHECKPOINT** items require manager or mentor confirmation
- Optional items don't block phase/instance completion

### Phase Completion

A phase is complete when all **required** items in that phase are complete.

### Instance Completion

- All phases must be complete
- Requires explicit completion action by manager or admin
- Generates completion timestamp

### Why Time is Insufficient

The system uses explicit completion rather than time-based:

- "30 days" doesn't mean readiness
- Progress varies by individual and role complexity
- Managers need visibility into actual blockers

## Access Control

| Action | Who Can Do It |
|--------|---------------|
| View templates | All org members |
| Create/edit templates | Admins only |
| Assign onboarding | Person's manager or Admin |
| View onboarding instance | Onboardee, Manager, Mentor, Admin |
| Complete items | Onboardee (or Manager/Mentor for checkpoints) |
| Complete onboarding | Manager or Admin |
| View oversight | Managers see their team; Admins see all |

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Start simple, iterate**  
  Create a basic template first, then refine it based on feedback. You can always add more phases and items later.
</Tip>

- **Use phases to structure the journey**  
  Group related items together (Day 1, Week 1, etc.) to help onboardees understand what to focus on when.

- **Mix item types**  
  Combine tasks, readings, meetings, and checkpoints to create a well-rounded onboarding experience.

- **Link to external resources**  
  Use item links to point to documentation, videos, or other resources that support onboarding.

- **Mark checkpoints for critical items**  
  Use CHECKPOINT items for things that must be verified (e.g., "Completed security training", "Met with manager").

- **Review and update templates regularly**  
  As your organization evolves, update templates to reflect current processes and expectations.

- **Use optional items for nice-to-haves**  
  Mark items as optional if they're helpful but not required. This keeps the focus on what matters most.
