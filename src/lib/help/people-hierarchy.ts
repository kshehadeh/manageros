The People Hierarchy view is your **org chart** inside mpath. It shows how people, teams, and reporting lines fit together.

Use it when you want to answer questions like:

- “Who does this person report to?”
- “Who is on this team?”
- “What does this manager’s span of control look like?”

---

## Overview

The hierarchy view gives you a **visual representation** of:

- Reporting relationships (manager → direct reports)
- Team and org structure
- How people move up and down the chain

From the chart, you can jump into:

- Individual **person profiles**
- **Teams** and their members

---

## Why the Hierarchy Matters (Benefits)

- **Faster onboarding and context sharing**  
  New managers and ICs can quickly see “who’s who” without digging through docs.

- **Better planning and staffing decisions**  
  Understand spans of control and team sizes when adding or moving people.

- **Clearer communication paths**  
  Know who to involve when initiatives or incidents cross teams.

- **A single source of truth for structure**  
  When properly maintained, this replaces scattered org diagrams.

---

## How to Use the Hierarchy View

### 1. Navigate the org

- Start from a known person (e.g. yourself or your manager).
- Move **up** to see your leadership chain.
- Move **down** to see teams and sub‑teams.

This is especially helpful in:

- Large organizations
- Matrixed environments with many teams

### 2. Prepare for cross‑team work

When working on cross‑team initiatives:

- Use the hierarchy to:
  - Identify managers and leads for involved teams.
  - Understand who may need to be consulted or informed.
- Combine with **People** and **Initiatives** views to see:
  - Who owns which work
  - Where dependencies live

### 3. Keep structure accurate

For admins and people ops:

- Update reporting lines when:
  - People move between teams
  - New teams are created or merged
  - Managers change
- Ensure job roles (\`job-roles\`) and reporting lines tell a **consistent story**.

## Examples & Best Practices

### Example: New manager onboarding

- A new EM joins and needs to understand the area quickly.
- Use the hierarchy to:
  - See all direct and indirect reports.
  - Understand how their area fits into the broader org.

### Example: Planning a reorg

- Use the chart to:
  - Visualize current structure and spans of control.
  - Simulate new shapes before implementing changes.

### Quick best practices

- **Keep the hierarchy up to date** – outdated org charts create confusion quickly.
- **Use clear and consistent role titles** so the chart is meaningful at a glance.
- **Review structure periodically** (e.g. quarterly) to make sure it still matches how work actually flows.
