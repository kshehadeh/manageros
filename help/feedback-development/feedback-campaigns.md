# Feedback Campaigns

Feedback campaigns help you **collect structured input from the right people at the right time** – for performance reviews, 360s, and quick “pulse” checks.

Used well, they turn scattered opinions into actionable insights for growth.

---

## Overview

A feedback campaign in mpath is a **focused cycle of feedback about a specific person**:

- You choose **who** the feedback is about.
- You choose **who** should respond (managers, peers, direct reports, stakeholders).
- You choose **what** to ask (via templates and questions).
- mpath handles **distribution, collection, and tracking**.

Common examples:

- 360‑degree feedback ahead of a promotion decision
- End‑of‑cycle performance feedback
- Pulse surveys on engagement or collaboration

## Why Feedback Campaigns Matter (Benefits)

- **Richer, multi‑source perspective**  
  See how someone shows up for their manager, peers, and reports – not just one direction.

- **More objective performance decisions**  
  Calibrations and promotions can be grounded in broad input, not only hallway opinions.

- **Regular signals on team health**  
  Pulse campaigns surface issues early so you can act before they become attrition.

- **Reusable, consistent formats**  
  Templates keep your evaluation criteria consistent across time and people.

## Key Campaign Types

### 360‑degree feedback

Use for:

- Promotion readiness checks
- Role transitions (e.g. new manager, new lead)
- Broader behavioral and collaboration feedback

You’ll typically invite:

- Manager(s)
- Peers and cross‑functional partners
- Direct reports (if applicable)

### Performance review campaigns

Use for:

- End‑of‑cycle evaluations
- Documenting progress against goals and expectations
- Feeding into formal review and calibration processes

These often combine:

- Rating scales aligned to your competency framework
- Free‑text questions for examples and recommendations

### Pulse surveys

Use for:

- Quick reads on engagement, psychological safety, or process changes
- Testing how a reorg, new process, or leadership change is landing

They are:

- Short, focused, and frequent enough to spot trends.

## How to Run a Feedback Campaign (Step‑by‑Step)

### 1. Decide the purpose and audience

Before you create anything in the UI, answer:

- “What decision will this feedback inform?”
- “Who needs to receive feedback?”
- “Who should be invited to give it?”

This keeps your campaign focused and respectful of people’s time.

### 2. Create the campaign

1. Go to **Feedback → Campaigns**.
2. Click **New campaign**.
3. Configure:
   - **Name** – clear and specific (e.g. “Q3 360 – Staff Engineer Candidates”).
   - **Target person** – who the feedback will be about.
   - **Template** – choose a pre‑built one or customize your own.
   - **Date range** – open and close dates for responses.
   - **Status** – start in `draft` while you review.

### 3. Select participants

1. Add feedback providers:
   - Manager(s)
   - Peers and partners
   - Direct reports or other stakeholders as needed
2. Decide on **anonymity**:
   - Fully anonymous for sensitive or broad feedback.
   - Identified when you want explicit accountability and follow‑up.

### 4. Launch and monitor

1. Activate the campaign and (optionally) send invites.
2. Use the campaign page to:
   - Track who has responded.
   - Send **reminders** to non‑responders.
   - Adjust the end date if you need more time.

### 5. Review and act on results

Once enough responses are in:

1. Review summaries and individual answers.
2. Look for:
   - Consistent themes across respondents.
   - Differences between groups (e.g. peers vs. reports).
   - Concrete examples to use in coaching or decisions.
3. Turn insights into:
   - **Development plans** and specific goals.
   - Updates to responsibilities or support.
   - Context for performance reviews and promotion discussions.

Share appropriate parts of the feedback with the recipient and agree on next steps.

## Examples & Best Practices

### Example: 360 ahead of a Staff promotion

- Target: Senior Engineer being considered for Staff.
- Invitees: Manager, tech leads, key peers, direct reports.
- Questions:
  - Impact on initiatives.
  - Technical leadership and collaboration.
  - Where they should focus next to succeed at Staff.
- Outcome:
  - Rich, structured input to bring into promotion discussions.

### Example: Post‑reorg pulse

- Target: Multiple people across a team or org.
- Purpose: Understand how the reorg is landing after 4–6 weeks.
- Questions:
  - Clarity of responsibilities.
  - Communication quality.
  - Where people are blocked or confused.
- Outcome:
  - Concrete actions to improve communication and clarify ownership.

### Quick best practices

- **Be clear about purpose** – tell respondents how their input will be used.
- **Ask for examples**, not just ratings – examples make feedback actionable.
- **Close the loop** – share themes and intended actions with recipients.
- **Don’t over‑campaign** – focus on a few high‑value cycles instead of constant surveys.
