<Info>
  Initiatives are the **big rocks** in your organization – strategic efforts
  that pull together people, tasks, and goals around a shared outcome.
</Info>

Use initiatives when you want to:

- Keep a **quarterly or multi-sprint effort** visible and on track
- Tie day‑to‑day tasks back to **clear objectives and outcomes**
- Give teams and stakeholders a **single source of truth** for status, risk, and ownership

## Overview

An initiative in mpath represents a **strategic project, OKR, or program**. It brings together:

## Why Initiatives Matter

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Connect strategy to execution">

See how individual tasks and objectives roll up into a bigger outcome. Instead of losing track of how daily work connects to strategic goals, initiatives make the relationship explicit and visible.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Create a shared narrative for leadership">

Use a single page to talk about status, risk, and confidence instead of scattered docs and spreadsheets. When stakeholders ask "How's that initiative going?", you have one place to point them to.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Clarify ownership">

Make it obvious who is accountable, who's involved, and which team is driving the work. No more confusion about who owns what or who to talk to about progress.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Focus attention where it matters">

RAG status and confidence make it easy to spot initiatives that need support before they go off the rails. You can quickly identify what needs your attention most.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Support recurring reviews">

Use initiatives as the backbone for weekly, bi‑weekly, or monthly check‑ins with leads and stakeholders. They become the natural agenda for status discussions.

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Key Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Initiative">

A container for a strategic effort. An initiative has:

- **Title & summary** – what you're doing and why
- **Outcome** – the primary result you're aiming for (e.g. "NPS > 50")
- **Dates** – when the initiative starts and when you're aiming to finish
- **Status** – `planning`, `in_progress`, `on_hold`, `completed`, or `cancelled`
- **RAG** – health indicator (`red`, `amber`, `green`)
- **Confidence** – 1–10 sense of how likely you are to hit the outcome

<Tip>
  Start with a clear, measurable outcome. If you can't measure success, you
  can't know if you've achieved it.
</Tip>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Objectives">

Objectives break the initiative into **measurable chunks of progress**:

- Each objective has a **title** and optional **key result**
- They act like **mini‑goals** within the initiative (e.g. "Improve DB performance – p95 < 100ms")
- They help frame discussions in check‑ins ("Which objectives are at risk?")

<Warning>
  Aim for 3–5 objectives per initiative. Too many objectives can dilute focus
  and make progress tracking difficult.
</Warning>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Owners & Team">

- **Owners** are specific people accountable for the initiative's success (engineering lead, PM, EM, etc.)
- You can add multiple owners with roles like `owner`, `tech lead`, or `product`
- Initiatives can also be linked to a **team**, which anchors the work to an org unit
- **Team information** is displayed on the initiative detail page, showing which team owns the initiative

<Tip>
  Assign clear ownership roles. Having multiple owners is fine, but make sure
  each person knows their specific responsibility. Linking to a team provides
  additional context about organizational ownership.
</Tip>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Tasks">

Tasks are the **execution layer**:

- Concrete work items that connect to an initiative and/or its objectives
- They carry status, priority, and assignees  
  (see the `tasks` help topic for more detail)

<Info>
  Tasks linked to initiatives automatically show up on the initiative detail
  page, making it easy to see what work is moving the needle.
</Info>

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How to Use Initiatives

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a new initiative">

1. Go to the **Initiatives** section.
2. Click **New initiative**.
3. Fill in:
   - **Title** – clear and specific (e.g. "Q4 Platform Resilience Upgrade")
   - **Summary** – 1–3 sentences describing the scope
   - **Outcome** – the result you care about (latency, NPS, revenue, etc.)
   - **Dates** – realistic start and target dates
   - **Status** – usually `planning` or `in_progress` when you create it
   - **RAG & confidence** – your honest starting point
4. Save the initiative – this becomes the home for related objectives and tasks.

<Tip>
  Be specific with your outcome. "Improve performance" is vague. "Reduce p95
  latency by 30%" is actionable and measurable.
</Tip>

</Step>

<Step title="Add objectives with clear key results">

1. From the initiative detail page, add **Objectives**.
2. For each objective, define:
   - A **title** (e.g. "Reduce p95 API latency")
   - An optional **key result** (e.g. "p95 < 150ms for top 10 endpoints")
3. Aim for **3–5 objectives** per initiative – enough to cover the work but still focused.

<Check>
  Good objectives have clear success criteria. If you can't tell when an
  objective is done, refine it.
</Check>

</Step>

<Step title="Assign owners and (optionally) a team">

1. Add one or more **owners**:
   - Use roles like `owner`, `tech lead`, `PM`, or `EM` to clarify responsibilities.
2. If the initiative belongs to a specific org unit, link a **team**:
   - This makes it easier to filter initiatives across the org.

<Warning>
  Don't skip ownership. Initiatives without clear owners tend to drift and lose
  momentum.
</Warning>

</Step>

<Step title="Link tasks to the initiative">

1. When creating or editing tasks, link them to the relevant **initiative** (and objective where applicable).
2. Or use the initiative actions dropdown to **Add Task** directly from the initiative page.
3. Use task status and priority to keep execution clear:
   - `status` shows where the work sits in the lifecycle (see `tasks`).
   - `priority` shows what should move first when schedules get tight (see `tasks`).
4. In reviews, start from the initiative and drill into tasks that are blocked or at risk.

<Tip>
  Link tasks as you create them, not after. It's easier to build the connection
  from the start than to retrofit it later. Use the initiative actions dropdown
  for quick task creation.
</Tip>

</Step>

<Step title="Use initiative actions for quick additions">

The initiative actions dropdown (available on initiative detail pages) provides quick access to common actions:

- **Add Task** - Create a new task linked to this initiative
- **Add Note** - Document context, decisions, or updates
- **Add Link** - Attach external resources (docs, dashboards, tickets)
- **Add Check-In** - Record progress updates and status changes
- **Add Objective** - Define new objectives and key results
- **Manage People** - Add or update initiative owners
- **Edit Initiative** - Modify initiative details
- **Delete Initiative** - Remove the initiative (if you have permissions)

<Tip>
  Use the actions dropdown to quickly add related items without navigating away
  from the initiative page. This keeps your workflow efficient and
  context-focused.
</Tip>

</Step>

<Step title="Run regular check‑ins">

1. On your **initiative detail** page, review:
   - Overall **status**, **RAG**, and **confidence**
   - Progress on each **objective**
   - Recently updated or blocked **tasks**
2. Adjust as needed:
   - Update status/RAG/confidence to reflect reality.
   - Add or re‑prioritize objectives if the scope shifts.
   - Reassign or clarify ownership when responsibilities change.
3. Use this page as the shared artifact in your **weekly / bi‑weekly reviews** with leads and stakeholders.

<Info>
  Regular check-ins keep initiatives alive. Set a recurring meeting to review
  initiatives and update their status.

## Examples & Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Example: Shipping a new feature set">

- **Initiative**: "Launch self‑serve onboarding for SMEs"
- **Outcome**: "Increase self‑serve signups by 30%"
- **Objectives**:
  - "Reduce time‑to‑value for new workspaces"
  - "Improve onboarding completion to 90%"
  - "Reduce support tickets for new users by 25%"
- **Tasks**:
  - Design flows, implement backend, instrument analytics, update docs
- **Usage**:
  - Weekly review with PM + EM: check RAG, confidence, and tasks that didn't move.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Example: Operational improvement initiative">

- **Initiative**: "Improve incident response"
- **Outcome**: "Cut P1 MTTR in half"
- **Objectives**:
  - "Standardize runbooks for top 10 incident types"
  - "Reduce alert noise by 40%"
  - "Train all on‑call engineers on new process"
- **Best practices**:
  - Make the **outcome measurable**.
  - Tie initiatives into **meetings** (e.g. weekly ops review) so it's regularly inspected.

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### General Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Start with the outcome** Write the outcome first, then add objectives and
  tasks that support it. This ensures everything you do is aligned with what
  you're trying to achieve.
</Tip>

- **Update RAG and confidence before reviews**  
  This keeps conversations focused on what changed and why. Don't wait until the meeting to think about status.

- **Limit the number of active initiatives per team**  
  Too many "important" things means nothing is truly important. Focus beats fragmentation.

<Warning>
  **Close out completed or cancelled initiatives** Use `completed` or
  `cancelled` so dashboards stay accurate and historical work stays readable.
  Don't let old initiatives clutter your view.
</Warning>
