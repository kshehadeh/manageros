Jira integration lets mpath pull in **ticket work and project activity** so your view of execution covers both tasks and Jira issues.

It’s especially useful when engineering teams live in Jira but managers want a **unified picture** across initiatives, tasks, and tickets.

---

## What You Get from the Jira Integration

With Jira connected you can:

- See a person’s **assigned issues and progress** alongside their mpath tasks.
- Understand how work on **initiatives** spans Jira projects and issue types.
- Use Jira activity in:
  - Person Overview and AI Synopsis reports.
  - Initiative reviews and capacity discussions.

The goal is to **reduce tab‑switching** and bring Jira context into the same surface you’re already using for people and initiatives.

## How to Set It Up (Step‑by‑Step)

### 1. Connect Jira to your organization

1. Go to **Settings → Jira Integration**.
2. Enter:
   - Your Jira base URL (e.g. \`https://yourcompany.atlassian.net\`).
   - Credentials (API token + email / app auth, depending on your setup).
3. Test the connection and save.

### 2. Link people to their Jira accounts

1. Open a person’s profile.
2. Use the **link Jira account** action (where available).
3. Map their Jira identity (username/email) to their mpath person record.

Once linked, mpath can attribute Jira issues to the right person.

### 3. Choose what to sync

- Select **projects** you care about.
- Optionally limit by:
  - **Issue types** (bugs, stories, tasks, etc.).
  - Other filters as supported.

This helps keep the integration focused on the work that matters most.

## How Managers and Teams Use It

### For managers

- In person and initiative views:
  - See **Jira issues** alongside tasks and initiatives.
  - Understand **where time is going** (feature work vs. bugs vs. interrupts).
- In reports:
  - Use Jira activity as part of the picture for reviews and planning.

### For engineers

- See all your work context in one place:
  - What you own in Jira.
  - How it ties back to initiatives and tasks in mpath.

---

## Best Practices & Guardrails

- **Use consistent naming** between Jira projects and mpath initiatives when possible.
- Regularly **review which projects are synced** so you’re not pulling noise.
- Train the team on:
  - What Jira data appears in mpath.
  - How it will be used (e.g. for planning, not micromanagement).

If data looks off:

- Check account linking and permissions.
- Verify project and issue type filters.
- Confirm Jira API status and credentials.
