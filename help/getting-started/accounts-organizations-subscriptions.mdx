<Info>
  **Understanding the foundation of mpath.** This guide explains how accounts, organizations, people, and subscriptions connect to create your team's workspace. Getting these relationships right unlocks all of mpath's features.
</Info>

## The Big Picture

mpath is built on three foundational concepts that work together:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
<Card title="Your Account" icon="key">
  Your login credentials and personal access to mpath. This is **you** as a user of the platform.
</Card>

<Card title="Your Organization" icon="building">
  Your company or team's workspace. All data—people, tasks, initiatives—lives here, isolated and secure.
</Card>

<Card title="Your Subscription" icon="credit-card">
  The plan that determines features and limits. Subscriptions are **organization-wide**, not per-user.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

---

## Understanding the Account → Person Relationship

One of the most important concepts in mpath is the distinction between your **Account** and your **Person** record. They serve different purposes:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Your Account (Login Identity)">

Your **account** is your login identity—the credentials you use to access mpath:

- **One account per email**: Each email address can only have one account
- **Authentication**: Handles your password, SSO, and security settings
- **Organization membership**: Connects you to one organization (or none yet)
- **User role**: Determines your permissions (User, Admin, or Owner)

Your account is managed through your user settings and handles all authentication concerns.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Your Person Record (Organizational Identity)">

Your **Person** record represents you as a member of your organization:

- **Organizational identity**: Appears in org charts, gets assigned tasks, participates in meetings
- **Relationships**: Has a manager, direct reports, and team assignments
- **Work context**: Owns initiatives, tasks, feedback, and one-on-ones
- **Independent existence**: Person records can exist even without a linked account (useful for tracking people who haven't joined yet)

<Tip>
  Person records are the foundation of organizational structure. Everything in mpath—from tasks to feedback—connects to people, not accounts.
</Tip>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Linking Account to Person">

When your account is **linked** to your Person record, you unlock personal features:

- ✅ Create and manage one-on-ones with your manager or reports
- ✅ See your own tasks, initiatives, and feedback
- ✅ Access personal reports and synopses
- ✅ Receive notifications relevant to your work
- ✅ Use "My Tasks" and personal dashboard views

**Without linking**, you can still access organization data (based on your role), but personal features won't know which Person is "you."

<Warning>
  If you can't access features like "My Tasks" or your one-on-ones, your account might not be linked to your Person record. Check with an organization admin.
</Warning>

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Organizations: Your Team's Workspace

An **organization** is your company or team's isolated workspace in mpath. Think of it as your team's private instance where all your data lives.

### Key Characteristics

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Data Isolation" icon="shield">
  You can only see data from your own organization. Complete privacy between different companies using mpath.
</Card>

<Card title="Shared Workspace" icon="users">
  All members share the same data and subscription limits. Collaboration happens within org boundaries.
</Card>

<Card title="Unique Identity" icon="fingerprint">
  Each organization has a unique name and URL slug (e.g., `acme-corp`) that identifies it across the platform.
</Card>

<Card title="Central Configuration" icon="gear">
  Organization-level settings control integrations, job roles, teams, and other shared configurations.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Organization Roles

When you join an organization, you're assigned one of three roles:

| Role | Capabilities |
|------|-------------|
| **User** | Standard member. Can view and interact with organization data based on entity-specific permissions. |
| **Admin** | Can manage organization settings, members, job roles, teams, and most data. Cannot manage billing. |
| **Owner** | Everything Admin can do, plus manages subscription and billing. Typically the organization creator. |

### Creating vs. Joining

<Steps>
<Step title="Creating a New Organization">

If you're starting fresh:

1. Sign up for mpath with your email
2. Choose a subscription plan during onboarding
3. Enter your organization name and unique slug
4. You become the **Owner** and **billing user**
5. Start inviting team members

</Step>

<Step title="Joining an Existing Organization">

If you're joining a team:

1. Receive an invitation email from an organization admin
2. Click the invitation link
3. Create your account (or sign in if you already have one)
4. You're automatically added to the organization
5. Ask an admin to link your account to your Person record

<Check>
  When you join via invitation, you'll automatically have the role assigned by the admin who invited you.
</Check>

</Step>
</Steps>

## Organization-Level Settings

Organizations have several configurable settings that affect everyone:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Job Roles & Levels" icon="briefcase" href="/people-teams/job-roles">
  Define job levels (Junior, Senior, Staff), domains (Engineering, Product), and specific roles. Creates a consistent language for career growth.
</Card>

<Card title="Integrations" icon="plug" href="/integrations/integrations">
  Connect third-party tools like GitHub and Jira. Organization-level setup enables individual account linking.
</Card>

<Card title="Teams" icon="users-round" href="/people-teams/teams">
  Create team structures with hierarchies. Teams can own initiatives and organize people into working groups.
</Card>

<Card title="Billing & Subscription" icon="credit-card">
  Manage your subscription plan, view usage, and update payment methods. Only accessible to the billing user.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Managing Organization Settings

To access organization settings:

1. Click your organization name in the sidebar or header
2. Select **Organization Settings**
3. Navigate to the relevant section:
   - **General**: Name, slug, and basic info
   - **Members**: Invite, remove, and manage member roles
   - **Job Roles**: Create and manage job levels, domains, and roles
   - **Integrations**: Connect GitHub, Jira, and other tools
   - **Billing**: View usage and manage subscription

<Tip>
  Regularly review your organization settings to ensure job roles are current, integrations are working, and team structures reflect reality.
</Tip>

## Billing & Subscriptions

Subscriptions in mpath are **organization-based**, not per-user. This means your entire organization shares one plan and its limits.

### How Billing Works

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Organization-Wide Subscription">

Your subscription applies to **everyone** in the organization:

- All members share the same feature limits
- One subscription per organization (no individual upgrades)
- Subscription changes apply immediately to everyone
- Limits are based on entity counts (people, initiatives, teams, etc.)

This keeps billing simple—you don't need to track individual seats or worry about per-user costs.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The Billing User">

One person in each organization is the **billing user**:

- Usually the organization creator/owner
- Has access to billing settings and payment methods
- Receives invoices and billing notifications
- Can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel the subscription
- Can transfer billing responsibility to another owner

<Info>
  Only the billing user can make changes to the subscription. If you need billing changes and you're not the billing user, contact your organization's owner.
</Info>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Feature Limits">

Subscriptions control how many entities you can create:

- **People**: How many person records you can have
- **Initiatives**: How many strategic projects you can track
- **Teams**: How many team groups you can create
- **Feedback Campaigns**: How many 360 campaigns you can run

**What happens at the limit?**
- ✅ You can still **view** all existing data
- ❌ You **cannot create** new items of that type
- 💡 You'll see a message explaining the limit
- ⬆️ Upgrade your plan to increase limits

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Subscription Plans

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Solo Plan (Free)" icon="user">
  Perfect for small teams getting started:
  - Up to 5 people
  - Up to 10 initiatives
  - Up to 2 teams
  - Up to 2 feedback campaigns
  - All core features included
</Card>

<Card title="Team Plan (Paid)" icon="users">
  For growing teams and larger organizations:
  - **Unlimited** people
  - **Unlimited** initiatives
  - **Unlimited** teams
  - **Unlimited** feedback campaigns
  - Priority support
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Viewing Your Usage

To see your current usage and limits:

1. Go to **Organization Settings → Billing**
2. View the usage dashboard showing:
   - Current count vs. limit for each entity type
   - Subscription status and renewal date
   - Available upgrades (if applicable)

## Common Scenarios

<Steps>
<Step title="I Just Signed Up—Now What?">

Welcome! Here's your path to getting started:

1. ✅ Your account is created
2. ✅ You chose a subscription plan
3. ✅ You created your organization
4. **Next**: Create your Person record and link it to your account
5. **Then**: Invite team members and build your org structure

<Check>
  Don't forget to link your account to your Person record! This unlocks personal features like "My Tasks" and one-on-ones.
</Check>

</Step>

<Step title="I Was Invited to Join">

You received an invitation email:

1. Click the invitation link
2. Create your account (or sign in if you have one)
3. You're now part of the organization
4. **Important**: Ask an admin to link your account to your Person record
5. Explore the People page to see your team

</Step>

<Step title="I Can't Access Personal Features">

If "My Tasks" or one-on-ones aren't working:

1. Go to **Settings → Account Linking**
2. Check if your account is linked to a Person record
3. If not linked, find your Person record and select it
4. Click "Link Account"
5. If you don't see your Person record, ask an admin to create it first

<Warning>
  Personal features require your account to be linked to your Person record. Without this link, mpath doesn't know which Person is "you."
</Warning>

</Step>

<Step title="I Want to Upgrade Our Plan">

To upgrade your subscription:

1. Go to **Organization Settings → Billing**
2. Review your current usage
3. Click "Manage Subscription"
4. Select the new plan
5. Complete payment
6. New limits apply immediately

<Info>
  Only the billing user (usually the organization owner) can manage subscriptions.
</Info>

</Step>

<Step title="I'm Reaching Our Limits">

If you're hitting subscription limits:

1. Check current usage in **Organization Settings → Billing**
2. Identify what's using the most capacity
3. Consider if you can archive or remove unused items
4. Upgrade to Team plan for unlimited capacity
5. Remember: You can still view everything, just can't create more

</Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding the Full Hierarchy

Here's how everything connects in mpath:

```
Organization
├── Subscription (shared by everyone)
│   └── Limits apply to entity counts
├── Members (user accounts with roles)
│   └── User | Admin | Owner
├── People (organizational identities)
│   ├── Linked to accounts (for personal features)
│   ├── Assigned to teams
│   ├── Have managers and reports
│   └── Own work: tasks, initiatives, meetings
├── Organization Settings
│   ├── Job Roles & Levels
│   ├── Integrations (GitHub, Jira)
│   └── Teams structure
└── Data (isolated per organization)
    ├── Initiatives & Objectives
    ├── Tasks
    ├── Meetings & One-on-Ones
    └── Feedback & Campaigns
```

<Info>
  Everything flows from your organization. When you query data, access controls ensure you only see what belongs to your organization and what you're permitted to access.
