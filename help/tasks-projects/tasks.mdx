<Info>
  Tasks are the **execution layer** of your work. They connect initiatives to
  daily action, and understanding **status** and **priority** helps you focus on
  what matters most.
</Info>

Tasks in mpath combine two powerful dimensions:

- **Status** – tells you **where** work is in its lifecycle (To Do, Doing, Blocked, Done, Dropped)
- **Priority** – tells you **how strongly you should pull it next** when time is limited (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Very Low)

Used together, they give you a complete picture: what needs attention now, what's moving, and what can wait.

## Overview

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Task Status" icon="list-checks">
  The current place of work in its lifecycle – from planning to completion
</Card>

<Card title="Task Priority" icon="flag">
  How urgently a task should be addressed when resources are constrained
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### The Relationship Between Status and Priority

Status answers: **"Where is this work?"**  
Priority answers: **"How important is it?"**

<Warning>
  Don't confuse status with priority. A task can be **High priority** but still
  in **To Do** status. Status shows progress; priority shows importance.
</Warning>

## Task Status

Task status is the **story of where work really is**. Used well, it keeps you and your team aligned on what's moving, what's stuck, and what's done.

### Why Status Matters

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Clarity in standups and check-ins">

You can quickly answer "What's in flight?" and "What's stuck?" without digging through multiple tools or asking for constant updates.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Less micro-management">

Leads and stakeholders can see progress from status changes instead of asking for constant updates. Status becomes a communication tool.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Better planning and re-prioritization">

Knowing how many tasks are in **Doing** or **Blocked** helps you decide what to start (or not start) next. You can spot bottlenecks before they become problems.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Cleaner history">

Using **Done** and **Dropped** properly keeps backlogs readable over time. You can see what was completed versus what was intentionally cancelled.

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Status Levels

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="📋 To Do" icon="circle">
  Work that is **agreed but not started**

- New tasks that just came in
- Items queued for the next sprint or cycle
- Ideas that have enough context to be actionable

  <Tip>
    If something is still very fuzzy, keep it out of the task list until it's clear enough to move into **To Do**.
  </Tip>
</Card>

<Card title="🔄 Doing" icon="play-circle">
  Work that is **actively being worked on**

- Currently being picked up or in progress
- Expected to move within the current day or two
- Should be discussed in standups if it lingers too long

  <Warning>
    If a task sits in **Doing** for many days without movement, either break it down or mark it **Blocked** with a clear reason.
  </Warning>
</Card>

<Card title="⏸️ Blocked" icon="pause-circle">
  Work that **cannot move forward right now**

- Waiting on another team, decision, or review
- Blocked by an incident or missing information
- Dependent on an upstream change that hasn't landed yet

  <Tip>
    Always record **why** it's blocked (e.g. in the task notes) so reviews can quickly unblock it.
  </Tip>
</Card>

<Card title="✅ Done" icon="check-circle">
  Work that is **truly complete**

- Acceptance criteria are met
- Code is merged and deployed as agreed for your team
- Any necessary follow-ups (docs, communication) are finished

  <Check>
    Only mark tasks as **Done** when they're truly complete. If something still requires more work, keep it in **Doing** or create follow-up tasks.
  </Check>
</Card>

<Card title="🗑️ Dropped" icon="x-circle">
  Work you've **intentionally decided not to do**

- Scope changes made an item obsolete
- You tried something and decided not to continue
- A competing initiative or task replaced this work

  <Info>
    This helps keep history accurate without pretending everything "finished". Dropped tasks provide valuable context about decisions made.
  </Info>
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Status Workflow

<Steps>
<Step title="Create tasks into To Do">

As work is discovered or planned, create tasks in **To Do** status. This is your backlog of agreed-upon work.

</Step>

<Step title="Move to Doing when work starts">

When someone picks up a task, move it to **Doing**. This signals active work and helps track work-in-progress limits.

</Step>

<Step title="Mark Blocked when obstacles arise">

If progress depends on something else, move it to **Blocked** and document the reason. This invites help and makes dependencies visible.

</Step>

<Step title="Mark Done when truly complete">

When the work is finished and meets acceptance criteria, move it to **Done**. This closes the loop and keeps your active work visible.

</Step>

<Step title="Use Dropped for intentional cancellations">

If you decide not to do a task, move it to **Dropped** instead of deleting it. This preserves decision history.

</Step>
</Steps>

### Status Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="During standups and check-ins">

- Start by scanning **Blocked** tasks:
  - "What needs unblocking today?"
  - "Who can help remove these blockers?"
- Then look at **Doing**:
  - "What has been in Doing for too long?"
  - "Should we split any of these into smaller tasks?"
- Use **To Do** to decide **what to pull next**, aligning with priorities.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Avoiding 'everything is Doing'">

Instead of:

- 10 tasks all in **Doing** with no clear progress

Do this:

- Limit the number of **Doing** tasks per engineer
- Keep future work in **To Do** until there is capacity
- Move stalled items into **Blocked** with a clear reason

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="For planning and retros">

Use the distribution of **To Do / Doing / Blocked / Done / Dropped** to:

- Spot patterns (e.g. many tasks getting Dropped late in the cycle)
- Understand whether work is being over-started
- Learn which dependencies frequently cause **Blocked** status

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Task Priority

Task priorities tell your team **what should move first** when time and attention are limited. Used consistently, they prevent everything from feeling "urgent" and make trade-offs explicit.

### Why Priorities Matter

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Aligns the team on what's truly important">

Engineers don't have to guess which of 10 tasks to do next. Priority provides clear guidance on what matters most.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Helps with realistic planning">

When time is tight, you can drop or move **Low** items without derailing outcomes. Priorities make trade-offs explicit and defensible.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Supports clear stakeholder conversations">

You can point to a set of **High** items and say "these are the commitments." This creates accountability and sets expectations.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Reduces decision fatigue">

A small, meaningful set of priorities avoids endless sorting and re-sorting. You spend less time deciding what to do and more time doing it.

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Priority Levels

mpath uses a 5-level priority system (1-5, where 1 is highest priority):

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="🔴 Critical (P1)" icon="alert-triangle">
  **Reserve for a small set of work that truly needs to move now**

- Critical work to hit a near-term deadline
- Tasks blocking other teams or initiatives
- Incident follow-ups that meaningfully reduce risk

  <Warning>
    Keep **Critical** items **visible and few** (typically 1-3 per person or team). If everything is Critical, nothing is.
  </Warning>
</Card>

<Card title="🟠 High (P2)" icon="arrow-up">
  **Important work that should move soon**

- Work tied to current commitments and initiatives
- Tasks that impact near-term outcomes
- Important follow-ups that should happen this cycle

  <Tip>
    These are often your **default** high-priority tasks for the current sprint or week.
  </Tip>
</Card>

<Card title="🟡 Medium (P3)" icon="minus">
  **Important but not immediately urgent**

- Regular feature work tied to initiatives
- Enhancements that improve user experience or productivity
- Follow-ups that should happen this cycle but not necessarily today

  <Info>
    These are often your **default** tasks for the current sprint or week when High priority items are under control.
  </Info>
</Card>

<Card title="🟢 Low (P4)" icon="arrow-down">
  **Valuable but easily deferred**

- Nice-to-have improvements
- Experiments or ideas you might explore later
- Maintenance tasks that matter but won't hurt if delayed

  <Tip>
    Low priority tasks are great for filling small gaps in time, onboarding new team members, or "if we get to it" time at the end of a cycle.
  </Tip>
</Card>

<Card title="⚪ Very Low (P5)" icon="arrow-down-circle">
  **Nice-to-have work with minimal urgency**

- Future exploration ideas
- Long-term improvements
- Tasks that can wait indefinitely without impact

  <Info>
    Use Very Low as a parking lot for ideas, not a graveyard. Review regularly and either promote or drop them.
  </Info>
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Priority Comparison

Lower numbers = higher priority:

| Priority | Value | Label | When to Use                      |
| -------- | ----- | ----- | -------------------------------- |
| Critical | 1     | P1    | Must move now to hit commitments |
| High     | 2     | P2    | Important work for current cycle |
| Medium   | 3     | P3    | Important but not urgent         |
| Low      | 4     | P4    | Valuable but easily deferred     |
| Very Low | 5     | P5    | Nice-to-have, minimal urgency    |

### Using Priority in Practice

<Steps>
<Step title="During planning">

1. Start from initiatives and outcomes
2. For each task, ask:
   - "Does this directly impact our current commitments?"
   - "What happens if we don't do this this cycle?"
3. Assign:
   - **Critical** to the few tasks that _must_ move to hit those commitments
   - **High** to important work for the current cycle
   - **Medium** to the rest of the planned work
   - **Low** to nice-to-haves and future ideas
   - **Very Low** to exploration and long-term improvements

</Step>

<Step title="During execution">

When someone has capacity:

1. Look for **Critical** tasks in **To Do** first
2. If there are none, pull a **High** that aligns with current initiatives
3. Only pull **Medium** when High/Critical are under control
4. Only pull **Low** or **Very Low** when higher priorities are handled

When something new comes in:

- If it is more important than existing **Critical** items, mark it **Critical** and consider lowering or dropping something else
- If not, start it as **High**, **Medium**, or **Low** and communicate clearly about timing

</Step>

<Step title="When priorities change">

- Revisit priorities **weekly** or whenever plans shift
- Explicitly **downgrade or drop** items instead of leaving them marked **Critical** forever
- Use these changes as input into conversations about **capacity vs. demand**

</Step>
</Steps>

### Priority Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Limit Critical and High">

If everything is Critical or High, nothing is. Keep these categories small and meaningful. Typically:

- 1-3 **Critical** tasks per person or team
- 3-5 **High** tasks per person or team

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Pair priority with status">

Focus on **Critical + Doing / To Do** first. A task can be Critical but still in To Do – that's fine, it just means it's ready to be pulled when capacity opens.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Be explicit when you downgrade">

Communicate to stakeholders when a task moves from Critical → High or High → Medium. This maintains trust and sets expectations.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use Low/Very Low as a parking lot, not a graveyard">

Review Low and Very Low items regularly and either promote or drop them. Don't let them accumulate indefinitely.

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Combining Status and Priority

The real power comes from using status and priority together. Here's how they work in combination:

### Priority × Status Matrix

| Status      | Critical         | High                   | Medium                | Low                 | Very Low            |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| **To Do**   | Pull immediately | Pull soon              | Pull when capacity    | Pull if time allows | Review periodically |
| **Doing**   | Monitor closely  | Track progress         | Normal tracking       | Low urgency         | Minimal tracking    |
| **Blocked** | Unblock urgently | Unblock soon           | Unblock when possible | Unblock if needed   | Can wait            |
| **Done**    | Celebrate wins   | Acknowledge completion | Standard completion   | Quiet completion    | Archive             |
| **Dropped** | Document why     | Note cancellation      | Standard drop         | Quiet drop          | Cleanup             |

### Example Workflows

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Example: Quarterly initiative planning">

**Initiative**: "Improve sign-up conversion"

- **Critical priority tasks**:
  - A/B test new pricing page
  - Fix a major bug in the signup flow
- **High priority tasks**:
  - Improve form validation messages
  - Add a confirmation email tweak
- **Medium priority tasks**:
  - Refactor related module for clarity
- **Low priority tasks**:
  - Explore a new experiment idea for later

**Status flow**: Tasks start in **To Do**, move to **Doing** when picked up, and **Done** when complete.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Example: Production incident follow-up">

- **Critical**:
  - Add missing alert for the failure path → **Doing**
  - Patch the root cause in the hot path → **Doing**
- **High**:
  - Document incident response process → **To Do**
- **Medium**:
  - Refactor related module for clarity → **To Do**
- **Low**:
  - Write a blogpost about the incident → **To Do**

**Status flow**: Critical items move quickly through **Doing** to **Done**. Lower priority items wait in **To Do** until capacity opens.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Example: Healthy daily workflow">

1. **Morning standup**: Review **Blocked** tasks first (regardless of priority) – unblock what you can
2. **Start of day**: Pull **Critical** tasks from **To Do** into **Doing**
3. **During work**: Move tasks through **Doing** → **Done** as you complete them
4. **End of day**: Review **Doing** tasks – if something has been stuck, move to **Blocked** with a reason
5. **Weekly review**: Revisit priorities – downgrade tasks that are no longer critical, promote tasks that became urgent

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

| High     | 2     | P2    | Important, move soon     |
| Medium   | 3     | P3    | Important but not urgent |
| Low      | 4     | P4    | Valuable but deferrable  |
| Very Low | 5     | P5    | Nice-to-have             |

### Best Practices Summary

<Tip>
  **Update status as part of your working habit**, not just before reviews.
  Status should reflect reality, not aspirations.
</Tip>

<Check>
  **Pair status with priority** for a full picture of _what_ to do and _when_.
  Status shows progress; priority shows importance.
</Check>

<Warning>
  **Limit Critical and High priorities**. If everything is Critical or High,
  nothing is. Keep these categories small and meaningful.
</Warning>

<Info>
  **Prefer Blocked over silent stagnation**. Moving a task to Blocked invites
  help and makes dependencies visible. It's better than letting tasks sit in
  Doing without progress.
