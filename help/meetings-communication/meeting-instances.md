# Meeting Instances

Meeting instances are the **actual occurrences on your calendar** – the individual sessions created from a recurring meeting.

This is where you track **what really happened**: who attended, what you decided, and which action items were created.

---

## Overview

For a recurring meeting:

- The **meeting** defines the series (title, pattern, participants, associations).
- **Meeting instances** are the **per‑occurrence records**:
  - Specific date and time
  - Actual participants and attendance
  - Notes, decisions, and action items

You can customize each instance **without breaking the series**.

---

## Why Meeting Instances Matter (Benefits)

- **Accurate history of conversations and decisions**  
  Each instance keeps its own notes and attendance.

- **Flexible scheduling without chaos**  
  You can move or cancel a single occurrence without changing the whole series.

- **Clear follow‑through**  
  Action items from a given instance can be tracked as tasks linked back for context.

- **Better reviews and retros**  
  Looking across instances shows how a team or initiative has evolved over time.

## Key Concepts

### Instance schedule

Each instance has:

- Its **own date/time** (which can differ from the original pattern)
- A link back to the **meeting series**

You can reschedule one session (e.g. due to a holiday) without changing others.

### Participants, status, and attendance

For each instance you can track:

- **Participant status** – `invited`, `accepted`, `declined`, `tentative`
- **Attendance** – `attended`, `absent`, `excused`

This lets you see who actually joined a given session.

### Notes and action items

Instance notes capture:

- Agenda adjustments
- Discussion points and decisions
- Action items that should become tasks

## How to Work with Instances (Step‑by‑Step)

### 1. Adjust a single occurrence

Use this when **one meeting in a series** needs to move:

1. Open the **specific meeting instance**.
2. Update the **date/time** or **location** as needed.
3. Optionally adjust participants (e.g. add a guest for this session only).
4. Save – only this instance is affected.

> If your entire cadence is shifting, update the **meeting series**, not each instance individually.

### 2. Capture notes and decisions

During or after the meeting:

1. Open the instance and add **notes**:
   - Key discussion points
   - Decisions and rationale
   - Risks or open questions
2. Highlight action items clearly so they can be turned into tasks.

### 3. Track attendance and participation

1. After the session, update:
   - Participant **status** if it changed
   - **Attendance** (`attended`, `absent`, `excused`) for each person
2. Use this history to:
   - Understand who regularly attends key rituals
   - Spot patterns (e.g. frequent no‑shows)

### 4. Create tasks from action items

1. From the instance notes, create **tasks** for follow‑ups.
2. Link tasks back to:
   - The **meeting instance** (for context)
   - The relevant **initiative** or **objective** where the work belongs
3. Review these tasks in future instances to close the loop.

## Examples & Best Practices

### Example: Skipping a holiday

- You have a weekly “Platform Sync” on Mondays.
- One Monday lands on a holiday.
- Instead of editing the whole series:
  - Open that instance and **cancel** or move just that occurrence.

### Example: Special guest review

- A quarterly planning instance includes a VP or stakeholder.
- For that instance only:
  - Add the stakeholder as a participant.
  - Tailor the notes and agenda to planning outcomes.

### Quick best practices

- **Keep instance notes focused on decisions and actions**, not full transcripts.
- **Record attendance promptly** after each session.
- **Cancel instances that are no longer needed** to keep schedules clean.
- Use instances as the **source of truth** when you need to remember “What did we decide last time?”
