# Database Interactions

## Code Organization

when adding new queries, do not put the orm queries in a component.  Instead, either use an existing function that does the same thing or create a new function in the appropriate lib folder that does the query.

## FORBIDDEN ACTIONS

Never do a database reset.  Always use the prisma schema to make changes to the database.
