Meetings in ManagerOS let you plan one-time or recurring sessions, invite participants, and connect discussions to work.

## Create a meeting

- **Title**: Name the meeting clearly
- **Description**: Purpose, agenda, or context
- **Date & time**: Start time; add duration in minutes
- **Location**: Room or video link
- **Participants**: Add people from your org and external guests
- **Owner**: Assign the coordinator responsible for the meeting

## Recurrence (optional)

Create a series with a repeat pattern. ManagerOS generates individual instances you can manage separately.

- Patterns: daily, weekly, monthly, bi‑monthly, semi‑annually
- Start/end dates define the range of generated instances

## Associations

Link meetings so work stays connected:

- Teams
- Initiatives and objectives
- Notes for preparation and outcomes

## Participant status

Track responses at the meeting level:

- invited, accepted, declined, tentative

## Best practices

- Share a short agenda and materials in advance
- Keep duration aligned to the content
- Invite only necessary participants
- Respect time zones for distributed teams

## Troubleshooting

- If invites aren’t received, verify email addresses and resend
- Adjust recurrence dates if instances aren’t appearing
- Update participants when team membership changes
