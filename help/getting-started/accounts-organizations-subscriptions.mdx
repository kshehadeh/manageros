<Info>
  **Understanding the foundation of mpath.** This guide explains how accounts,
  organizations, people, and subscriptions connect to create your team's
  workspace. Getting these relationships right unlocks all of mpath's features.
</Info>

## The Big Picture

mpath is built on three foundational concepts that work together:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
<Card title="Your Account" icon="key">
  Your login credentials and personal access to mpath. This is **you** as a user of the platform.
</Card>

<Card title='Your Organization' icon='building'>
  Your company or team's workspace. All data—people, tasks, initiatives—lives
  here, isolated and secure.
</Card>

<Card title="Your Subscription" icon="credit-card">
  The plan that determines features and limits. Subscriptions are **organization-wide**, not per-user.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

---

## Understanding the Account → Person Relationship

One of the most important concepts in mpath is the distinction between your **Account** and your **Person** record. They serve different purposes:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Your Account (Login Identity)">

Your **account** is your login identity—the credentials you use to access mpath:

- **One account per email**: Each email address can only have one account
- **Authentication**: Handles your password, SSO, and security settings
- **Organization membership**: Connects you to one organization (or none yet)
- **User role**: Determines your permissions (User, Admin, or Owner)

Your account is managed through your user settings and handles all authentication concerns.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Your Person Record (Organizational Identity)">

Your **Person** record represents you as a member of your organization:

- **Organizational identity**: Appears in org charts, gets assigned tasks, participates in meetings
- **Relationships**: Has a manager, direct reports, and team assignments
- **Work context**: Owns initiatives, tasks, feedback, and one-on-ones
- **Independent existence**: Person records can exist even without a linked account (useful for tracking people who haven't joined yet)

<Tip>
  Person records are the foundation of organizational structure. Everything in
  mpath—from tasks to feedback—connects to people, not accounts.
</Tip>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Linking Account to Person">

When your account is **linked** to your Person record, you unlock personal features:

- ✅ Create and manage one-on-ones with your manager or reports
- ✅ See your own tasks, initiatives, and feedback
- ✅ Access personal reports and synopses
- ✅ Receive notifications relevant to your work
- ✅ Use "My Tasks" and personal dashboard views

**Without linking**, you can still access organization data (based on your role), but personal features won't know which Person is "you."

<Warning>
  If you can't access features like "My Tasks" or your one-on-ones, your account
  might not be linked to your Person record. Check with an organization admin.
</Warning>

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

For detailed information about managing people in your organization, see the **[People guide](/people-teams/people)**.

## Organizations: Your Team's Workspace

An **organization** is your company or team's isolated workspace in mpath. Think of it as your team's private instance where all your data lives.

### Key Characteristics

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Data Isolation" icon="shield">
  You can only see data from your own organization. Complete privacy between different companies using mpath.
</Card>

<Card title='Shared Workspace' icon='users'>
  All members share the same data and subscription limits. Collaboration happens
  within org boundaries.
</Card>

<Card title='Unique Identity' icon='fingerprint'>
  Each organization has a unique name and URL slug (e.g., `acme-corp`) that
  identifies it across the platform.
</Card>

<Card title="Central Configuration" icon="gear">
  Organization-level settings control integrations, job roles, teams, and other shared configurations.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Organization Roles

When you join an organization, you're assigned one of three roles:

| Role      | Capabilities                                                                                        |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User**  | Standard member. Can view and interact with organization data based on entity-specific permissions. |
| **Admin** | Can manage organization settings, members, job roles, teams, and most data. Cannot manage billing.  |
| **Owner** | Everything Admin can do, plus manages subscription and billing. Typically the organization creator. |

### Creating vs. Joining

<Steps>
<Step title="Creating a New Organization">

If you're starting fresh:

1. Sign up for mpath with your email
2. Choose a subscription plan during onboarding
3. Enter your organization name and unique slug
4. You become the **Owner** and **billing user**
5. Start inviting team members

</Step>

<Step title="Joining an Existing Organization">

If you're joining a team:

1. Receive an invitation email from an organization admin
2. Click the invitation link
3. Create your account (or sign in if you already have one)
4. You're automatically added to the organization
5. Ask an admin to link your account to your Person record

<Check>
  When you join via invitation, you'll automatically have the role assigned by
  the admin who invited you.
</Check>

</Step>
</Steps>

## Organization-Level Settings

Organizations have several configurable settings that affect everyone:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Job Roles & Levels" icon="briefcase" href="/people-teams/job-roles">
  Define job levels (Junior, Senior, Staff), domains (Engineering, Product), and specific roles. Creates a consistent language for career growth.
</Card>

<Card title='Integrations' icon='plug' href='/integrations/integrations'>
  Connect third-party tools like GitHub and Jira. Organization-level setup
  enables individual account linking.
</Card>

<Card title='Teams' icon='users-round' href='/people-teams/teams'>
  Create team structures with hierarchies. Teams can own initiatives and
  organize people into working groups.
</Card>

<Card title="Billing & Subscription" icon="credit-card">
  Manage your subscription plan, view usage, and update payment methods. Only accessible to the billing user.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Managing Organization Settings

To access organization settings:

1. Click your organization name in the sidebar or header
2. Select **Organization Settings**
3. Navigate to the relevant section:
   - **General**: Name, slug, and basic info
   - **Members**: Invite, remove, and manage member roles

</Tip>

### Leaving an Organization

If you need to leave an organization:

1. Go to **Organization Settings**
2. Open the actions dropdown
3. Click **Leave Organization**
4. Confirm your decision

<Warning>
  **Restrictions on leaving:** - You cannot leave if you are the only admin or
  owner - You must assign another admin before leaving - Leaving will remove
  your access to all organization data - Your account will be unlinked from your
  Person record
</Warning>

### Deleting an Organization

Organization owners can delete their organization:

1. Go to **Organization Settings**
2. Open the actions dropdown
3. Click **Delete Organization**
4. Confirm the deletion (this action cannot be undone)

<Warning>
  **Deleting an organization is permanent and irreversible:** - All data will be
  permanently deleted - All members will lose access - This includes people,
  teams, initiatives, tasks, meetings, feedback, and all other data - Only
  organization owners can delete organizations
</Warning>

<Info>
  Consider exporting important data before deleting an organization. Once
  deleted, there is no way to recover the information.
</Info>

## Billing & Subscriptions

Subscriptions in mpath are **organization-based**, not per-user. This means your entire organization shares one plan and its limits.

### How Billing Works

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Organization-Wide Subscription">

Your subscription applies to **everyone** in the organization:

- All members share the same feature limits
- One subscription per organization (no individual upgrades)
- Subscription changes apply immediately to everyone
- Limits are based on entity counts (people, initiatives, teams, etc.)

This keeps billing simple—you don't need to track individual seats or worry about per-user costs.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The Billing User">

One person in each organization is the **billing user**:

- Usually the organization creator/owner
- Has access to billing settings and payment methods
- Receives invoices and billing notifications
- Can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel the subscription
- Can transfer billing responsibility to another owner

<Info>
  Only the billing user can make changes to the subscription. If you need
  billing changes and you're not the billing user, contact your organization's
  owner.
</Info>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Feature Limits">

Subscriptions control how many entities you can create:

- **People**: How many person records you can have
- **Initiatives**: How many strategic projects you can track
- **Teams**: How many team groups you can create
- **Feedback Campaigns**: How many 360 campaigns you can run

**What happens at the limit?**

- ✅ You can still **view** all existing data
- ❌ You **cannot create** new items of that type
- 💡 You'll see a message explaining the limit
- ⬆️ Upgrade your plan to increase limits

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Subscription Plans

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Solo Plan (Free)" icon="user">
  Perfect for small teams getting started:
  - Up to 5 people
  - Up to 10 initiatives
  - Up to 2 teams
  - Up to 2 feedback campaigns
  - All core features included
</Card>

<Card title="Team Plan (Paid)" icon="users">
  For growing teams and larger organizations:
  - **Unlimited** people
  - **Unlimited** initiatives
  - **Unlimited** teams
  - **Unlimited** feedback campaigns
  - Priority support
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Viewing Your Usage

To see your current usage and limits:

1. Go to **Organization Settings → Billing**
2. View the usage dashboard showing:
   - Current count vs. limit for each entity type
   - Subscription status and renewal date
   - Available upgrades (if applicable)

</Step>

<Step title="I Was Invited to Join">

You received an invitation email:

3. If not linked, find your Person record and select it
4. Click "Link Account"
5. If you don't see your Person record, ask an admin to create it first

To upgrade your subscription:

1. Go to **Organization Settings → Billing**
2. Review your current usage
3. Click "Manage Subscription"

<Step title="I'm Reaching Our Limits">

If you're hitting subscription limits:

1. Check current usage in **Organization Settings → Billing**
2. Identify what's using the most capacity
3. Consider if you can archive or remove unused items
4. Upgrade to Team plan for unlimited capacity
5. Remember: You can still view everything, just can't create more

</Step>

<Step title="I Need to Leave the Organization">

If you need to leave:

1. Go to **Organization Settings**
2. Open the actions dropdown

</Step>

<Step title="I Want to Delete the Organization">

If you're an owner and need to delete the organization:

1. Go to **Organization Settings**
2. Open the actions dropdown
3. Click **Delete Organization**
4. Confirm the deletion

<Warning>
  This permanently deletes all data and cannot be undone. Export important data
  first if needed.
</Warning>

</Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding the Full Hierarchy

Here's how everything connects in mpath:

```
Organization
├── Subscription (shared by everyone)
│   └── Limits apply to entity counts
├── Members (user accounts with roles)
│   └── User | Admin | Owner
├── People (organizational identities)
│   ├── Linked to accounts (for personal features)
│   ├── Assigned to teams
│   ├── Have managers and reports
│   └── Own work: tasks, initiatives, meetings
├── Organization Settings
│   ├── Job Roles & Levels
│   ├── Integrations (GitHub, Jira)
│   └── Teams structure
└── Data (isolated per organization)
    ├── Initiatives & Objectives
    ├── Tasks
    ├── Meetings & One-on-Ones
    └── Feedback & Campaigns
```

<Info>
  Everything flows from your organization. When you query data, access controls
  ensure you only see what belongs to your organization and what you're
  permitted to access.
