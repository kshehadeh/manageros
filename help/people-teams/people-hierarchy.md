# People Hierarchy

The people hierarchy shows the organizational structure of your team. This view helps you understand:

- **Reporting relationships** between team members
- **Management structure** and who reports to whom
- **Team composition** and organizational depth

## Key Features

- **Visual representation** of the org chart
- **Interactive navigation** to individual profiles
- **Role-based access** to different levels of the hierarchy

## Best Practices

- Keep the hierarchy updated as team changes occur
- Use clear role titles and descriptions
- Ensure proper reporting relationships are maintained
