<Info>
  Job roles in mpath describe **what a position is, how senior it is, and which
  domain it belongs to**. They give you a consistent language for hiring, career
  growth, and organizational analysis.
</Info>

Ever need to answer questions like:

- "What level is this person?"
- "How many Senior Engineers do we have?"
- "What's the difference between a Staff and Principal role?"

Job roles help you answer these questions and create clarity across your organization.

## What You'll Find Here

Job roles are built from three core pieces that work together:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
<Card title="Job Levels" icon="arrow-up-down">
  How senior the role is (e.g., Junior, Senior, Staff). Levels are ordered to show career progression.
</Card>

<Card title='Job Domains' icon='sitemap'>
  Which functional area it belongs to (e.g., Engineering, Product, Design).
  Domains help you organize by function.
</Card>

<Card title="Role Definitions" icon="briefcase">
  How level and domain combine into specific positions (e.g., Senior Software Engineer). Each role includes detailed descriptions.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

Once defined, job roles can be **assigned to people** and used across:

- The **People** view for filtering and organization
- Org planning and career frameworks
- Performance and calibration workflows
- Hiring and recruitment processes

## Why Job Roles Matter

You might be wondering: "Why do I need structured job roles?" Here's why they're so valuable:

<Tip>
  **Clarity for people and managers** Everyone understands what a role means,
  how it's expected to operate, and what "next level" looks like. This
  eliminates confusion about expectations and career paths.
</Tip>

- **Consistency in hiring and promotion**  
  Candidates and internal moves are evaluated against the same expectations. No more "what does Senior mean here?" questions.

- **Better reporting and planning**  
  You can see how many people you have at each level and in each domain. This helps with org planning, identifying gaps, and making data-driven decisions.

- **Foundation for career growth**  
  Clear levels and descriptions help people understand what they need to do to advance. Managers can use them to guide development conversations.

## Key Concepts

Let's break down how job roles work:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Job Levels">

Levels represent **seniority and scope** within your organization. For example:

- **Junior** → entry-level roles
- **Professional** → core individual contributors
- **Senior Professional** → experienced ICs with broader scope
- **Staff / Principal** → strategic technical leaders

**Level Ordering**: Job levels are displayed in order from lowest to highest seniority. This order:

- Determines how levels appear in selection dropdowns
- Helps establish clear career progression paths
- Makes it easy to understand the hierarchy at a glance

You can drag and drop levels to reorder them, with visual feedback and automatic persistence.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Job Domains">

Domains represent **functional areas** in your organization, such as:

- **Engineering** - Software development and technical roles
- **Product** - Product management and strategy
- **Design** - User experience and visual design
- **Marketing** - Marketing and communications

Domains help you:

- Slice the org by function
- Understand where skills sit
- Plan hiring and growth by area
- Analyze distribution across functions

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Job Roles">

A job role combines **level + domain + description** into a concrete position:

- "Senior Software Engineer" (Senior Professional, Engineering)
- "Staff Product Manager" (Staff, Product)
- "UX Designer" (multiple levels, Design)

Each role can include:

- **Responsibilities** - What the role is expected to do
- **Requirements** - Skills, experience, and qualifications needed
- **Growth expectations** - Signals for readiness to move to the next level

Job descriptions support markdown formatting, so you can create rich, detailed role definitions.

</AccordionGroup>

## How to Manage Job Roles

Here's how to set up and manage job roles in mpath:

<Steps>
<Step title="Set up levels and domains (Administrators)">

As an administrator, start by creating the foundation:

1. Go to **Organization Settings → Job Role Management**
2. Create **job levels**:
   - Click "Add Level" in the Job Levels section
   - Enter level name (e.g., "Junior", "Senior", "Staff")
   - Click "Create" to save
   - New levels automatically receive the next order number
3. **Order job levels**:
   - Drag and drop levels to reorder them (use the grip handle ⋮⋮)
   - Order numbers automatically update based on position
   - Lower order numbers appear first in dropdown menus
4. Create **job domains**:
   - Click "Add Domain" in the Job Domains section
   - Enter domain name (e.g., "Engineering", "Product")
   - Click "Create" to save

<Check>
  Start with your core levels and domains. You can always add more later as your
  organization evolves.
</Check>

</Step>

<Step title="Create job roles">

Once you have levels and domains, create specific job roles:

1. In the Job Roles section, click **Add Job Role**
2. Fill in the details:
   - **Title** - The role name (e.g., "Senior Software Engineer")
   - **Level** - Selected from the levels you defined
   - **Domain** - Selected from your domains
   - **Description** - Responsibilities, expectations, and requirements (supports markdown)
3. Click "Create" to save

Roles become available everywhere a **job role** can be selected.

</Step>

<Step title="Assign roles to people">

You can assign job roles when:

- **Creating a new person** from the People page
- **Editing an existing person's** profile

1. Navigate to People → Add Person (or edit an existing person)
2. Fill in basic information
3. In the "Job Role" section, select a role from the dropdown
4. Save the person

This keeps people data, hierarchy, and career paths aligned.

</Step>

<Step title="Edit and maintain roles">

Keep your job roles current:

- **Edit**: Click the "Edit" button next to any level, domain, or role
- **Delete**: Click the "Delete" button (only allowed if no roles/people are assigned)

<Warning>
  You cannot delete levels or domains that have job roles assigned, or job roles
  that have people assigned. You must first reassign or remove the people from
  that role.
</Warning>

</Step>
</Steps>

## Job Descriptions

Job descriptions support markdown formatting, so you can create rich, detailed role definitions:

```markdown
### Responsibilities

- Design and implement software solutions
- Mentor junior team members
- Collaborate with product and design teams

### Requirements

- **Experience**: 5+ years in software development
- **Skills**: React, TypeScript, Node.js
- **Education**: Computer Science degree or equivalent

### Preferred Qualifications

- Previous startup experience
- Knowledge of cloud platforms
- Experience with mobile development
```

Use descriptions to capture:

- Responsibilities and expected scope
- Technical and leadership expectations
- Signals for readiness to move to the next level

## Real-World Examples

Let's see how job roles work in practice:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Building an engineering ladder">

You're setting up a clear engineering progression:

**Levels**: Junior → Professional → Senior Professional → Staff → Principal

**Domains**: Engineering, Product, Design

**Roles**:

- "Software Engineer" (Professional, Engineering)
- "Senior Software Engineer" (Senior Professional, Engineering)
- "Staff Software Engineer" (Staff, Engineering)

Each role has detailed descriptions covering responsibilities, technical expectations, and growth signals. This creates a clear career path that everyone understands.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Planning hiring for next year">

Use job roles to make data-driven hiring decisions:

1. See how many people you have at each level in each domain
2. Spot gaps (e.g., missing Staff-level engineers in key domains)
3. Plan which roles to open for hiring
4. Ensure balanced representation across functional areas

This helps you identify where you need to invest in hiring and growth.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Handling promotions">

When someone gets promoted:

1. Go to their profile from the People page
2. Edit their job role assignment
3. Select their new role (e.g., from "Senior Software Engineer" to "Staff Software Engineer")
4. Optionally update the job role description if expectations have changed

The change is immediately reflected across mpath, keeping everything in sync.

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Viewing Job Role Information

Job roles appear throughout mpath:

<CardGroup cols={2}>

  Job roles appear in a dedicated "Job Role" column. Shows role title with level and domain information. Displays as "—" for people without assigned roles.
</Card>

<Card title="In Person Details" icon="user">

</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Best Practices

Here are some tips to get the most out of job roles:

<Tip>
  **Keep role descriptions current** Update job descriptions when expectations
  change. Outdated descriptions create confusion and misalignment. Set a
  reminder to review them quarterly.
</Tip>

- **Review levels and roles periodically** with HR/people ops. Organizations evolve, and your job roles should too.

- **Use roles consistently in performance and calibration** so evaluation criteria are clear. Everyone should be evaluated against the same expectations for their role.

- **Start with levels** - Define the organizational hierarchy first, then map domains, then create specific roles.

- **Keep it simple at first** - You don't need every possible role from day one. Start with your core roles and expand as needed.

- **Align with compensation** - Ensure levels align with your compensation philosophy. This helps with fairness and transparency.
