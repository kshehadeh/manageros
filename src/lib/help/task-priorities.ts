Task priorities tell your team **what should move first** when time and attention are limited.

Used consistently, they prevent everything from feeling “urgent” and make trade‑offs explicit.

---

## Overview

Each task in mpath has a priority that answers:

- **High** – “We need this to move now.”
- **Medium** – “Important, should happen soon.”
- **Low** – “Valuable, but okay to slip if needed.”

Status (\`To Do\`, \`Doing\`, etc.) tells you **where** work is.  
Priority tells you **how strongly you should pull it next**.

---

## Why Priorities Matter (Benefits)

- **Aligns the team on what’s truly important**  
  Engineers don’t have to guess which of 10 tasks to do next.

- **Helps with realistic planning**  
  When time is tight, you can drop or move **Low** items without derailing outcomes.

- **Supports clear stakeholder conversations**  
  You can point to a set of **High** items and say “these are the commitments.”

- **Reduces decision fatigue**  
  A small, meaningful set of priorities avoids endless sorting and re‑sorting.

## Priority Levels

### 🔴 High Priority

Reserve **High** for a **small set of work that truly needs to move now**:

- Critical work to hit a near‑term deadline
- Tasks blocking other teams or initiatives
- Incident follow‑ups that meaningfully reduce risk

Best practices:

- Keep **High** items **visible and few** (typically 3–5 per person or team).
- Review them in every standup or planning session.

### 🟡 Medium Priority

Use **Medium** for work that is **important but not immediately urgent**:

- Regular feature work tied to initiatives
- Enhancements that improve user experience or productivity
- Follow‑ups that should happen this cycle but not necessarily today

These are often your **default** tasks for the current sprint or week.

### 🟢 Low Priority

Use **Low** for **valuable but easily deferred** work:

- Nice‑to‑have improvements
- Experiments or ideas you might explore later
- Maintenance tasks that matter but won’t hurt if delayed

Low priority tasks are great for:

- Filling small gaps in time
- Onboarding new team members
- “If we get to it” time at the end of a cycle

## How to Use Priorities in Practice

### During planning

1. Start from initiatives and outcomes.  
2. For each task, ask:
   - “Does this directly impact our current commitments?”  
   - “What happens if we don’t do this this cycle?”
3. Assign:
   - **High** to the few tasks that *must* move to hit those commitments.
   - **Medium** to the rest of the planned work.
   - **Low** to nice‑to‑haves and future ideas.

### During execution

When someone has capacity:

1. Look for **High** tasks in **To Do** first.  
2. If there are none, pull a **Medium** that aligns with current initiatives.  
3. Only pull **Low** when High/Medium are under control.

When something new comes in:

- If it is more important than existing **High** items, mark it **High** and consider lowering or dropping something else.
- If not, start it as **Medium** or **Low** and communicate clearly about timing.

### When priorities change

- Revisit priorities **weekly** or whenever plans shift.
- Explicitly **downgrade or drop** items instead of leaving them marked **High** forever.
- Use these changes as input into conversations about **capacity vs. demand**.

## Examples & Best Practices

### Example: Quarterly initiative planning

- Initiative: “Improve sign‑up conversion”  
- High priority tasks:
  - A/B test new pricing page
  - Fix a major bug in the signup flow
- Medium priority tasks:
  - Improve form validation messages
  - Add a confirmation email tweak
- Low priority tasks:
  - Explore a new experiment idea for later

### Example: Production incident follow‑up

- High:
  - Add missing alert for the failure path
  - Patch the root cause in the hot path
- Medium:
  - Refactor related module for clarity
- Low:
  - Write a blogpost about the incident

### Quick best practices

- **Limit High** – if everything is High, nothing is.
- **Pair priority with status** – focus on High + Doing / To Do first.
- **Be explicit when you downgrade** – communicate to stakeholders when a task moves from High → Medium or Low.
- **Use Low as a parking lot**, not a graveyard – review Low items regularly and either promote or drop them.
