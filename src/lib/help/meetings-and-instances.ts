mpath separates **meetings** (the series or one‑time event) from **meeting instances** (each actual occurrence). Understanding the difference helps you design effective rhythms instead of “just more meetings”.

---

## Overview: Meetings vs Meeting Instances

- A **meeting** defines:
  - The purpose and structure (title, description, agenda)
  - The base schedule (date/time and recurrence pattern)
  - Default participants and a meeting owner
  - Associations to teams, initiatives, and objectives

- A **meeting instance** is:
  - One specific occurrence on a particular date
  - Where you capture **notes, attendance, and action items**
  - Independently reschedulable or cancelable

Think of it as:

- **Meeting** → “Our weekly platform sync, every Monday at 10:00.”
- **Instance** → “This Monday’s platform sync, where we discussed Q3 incidents.”

---

## Why This Model Matters (Benefits)

- **Cleaner calendars and history**  
  Change details for a single occurrence without breaking the whole series.

- **Better decision tracking**  
  Each instance holds the specific decisions and actions from that session.

- **Clear ownership and expectations**  
  The series defines who should generally be there; instances record who actually was.

- **Stronger connection to work**  
  Meetings tie directly into initiatives and tasks, so discussions drive execution.

## Types of Meetings

### One‑time meetings

Use one‑time meetings for:

- Ad‑hoc discussions and incident reviews
- Interviews, performance conversations, or special workshops
- One‑off deep dives with stakeholders

These are simple: one schedule, one occurrence, individual notes and tasks.

### Recurring meetings

Use recurring meetings for:

- Weekly team syncs
- Bi‑weekly planning or grooming
- Monthly initiative reviews or leadership check‑ins

You define:

- **Pattern** – daily, weekly, monthly, bi‑monthly, semi‑annually
- **Participants** – who is expected each time
- **Associations** – which teams/initiatives this ritual supports

mpath generates instances automatically based on this pattern.

## Designing a Meeting + Instance Workflow

### 1. Create the meeting (series or one‑time)

1. Choose a clear **title** and write a short **purpose**:
   - “What decisions or outcomes is this meeting responsible for?”
2. Set:
   - **Date & time**
   - **Duration**
   - **Location** (physical room or video link)
3. Add **participants** and assign a **meeting owner** (often the EM, PM, or team lead).
4. If this is recurring, configure the **recurrence pattern** and date range.
5. Associate the meeting with relevant **teams** and **initiatives**.

### 2. Use instances to track reality

For each occurrence:

- Adjust the specific **time or location** if needed.
- Confirm who’s actually attending and record **attendance** afterward.
- Capture **instance‑specific notes**:
  - What changed since last time?
  - What decisions did we make?
  - What actions did we take on previous follow‑ups?

### 3. Turn outcomes into tasks

- From the instance notes, create **tasks**:
  - Link them back to the **meeting instance** and relevant **initiative**.
  - Assign owners and due dates.
- In the next instance, review these tasks to close the loop.

## Examples & Best Practices

### Example: Weekly team sync

- **Meeting (series)**:
  - Weekly, 45 minutes, same participants and agenda.
  - Linked to the team and its key initiatives.
- **Instances**:
  - Each one tracks:
    - What changed on initiatives (RAG, confidence, key risks)
    - Which tasks were created or closed
    - Who attended and who missed

### Example: Monthly stakeholder review

- **Meeting (series)**:
  - Monthly review with engineering, product, and leadership.
  - Linked to cross‑team initiatives and objectives.
- **Instances**:
  - Capture decisions on scope, priority shifts, and risks.
  - Spawn tasks for follow‑ups and communication work.

### Quick best practices

- **Define meetings around decisions, not just updates.**  
  Every recurring meeting should clearly state what it is accountable for.

- **Review recurring meetings quarterly.**  
  Kill or reshape meetings that no longer provide clear value.

- **Keep instance notes focused and action‑oriented.**  
  You should be able to skim an instance and quickly see “decisions + actions”.

- **Use initiatives and tasks as anchors.**  
  Let meetings be the place where you review and adjust, not the only place work lives.

## Meeting Types

### One-Time Meetings

- **Single occurrence** meetings with specific date and time
- **Direct scheduling** without recurrence patterns
- **Simple participant management** and status tracking
- **Individual notes** and follow-up actions

### Recurring Meetings

- **Series of meetings** with consistent participants and agenda
- **Multiple recurrence patterns:**
  - Daily
  - Weekly
  - Monthly
  - Bi-monthly
  - Semi-annually
- **Automatic instance generation** based on pattern
- **Consistent structure** across all instances

## Meeting Creation

### Basic Information

- **Title** - Clear, descriptive meeting name
- **Description** - Meeting purpose and agenda
- **Date and time** - Scheduled start time
- **Duration** - Meeting length in minutes
- **Location** - Physical or virtual meeting space

### Participants

- **Add team members** from your organization
- **Set initial status** (invited, accepted, declined, tentative)
- **Include external participants** via email
- **Assign meeting owner** for responsibility

### Associations

- **Link to teams** for team-specific meetings
- **Connect to initiatives** for project meetings
- **Associate with objectives** for goal-focused sessions
- **Add meeting notes** for context and preparation

## Meeting Instances

### Instance Management

- **Individual instances** for each occurrence of recurring meetings
- **Instance-specific notes** and updates
- **Participant status tracking** per instance
- **Attendance recording** (attended, absent, excused)

### Instance Features

- **Flexible scheduling** - Modify individual instance times
- **Instance-specific notes** - Capture unique discussion points
- **Participant management** - Add/remove participants per instance
- **Status updates** - Track attendance and participation

### Instance Statuses

- **Invited** - Participant has been invited
- **Accepted** - Participant confirmed attendance
- **Declined** - Participant cannot attend
- **Tentative** - Participant unsure about attendance
- **Attended** - Participant was present
- **Absent** - Participant did not attend

## Meeting Workflow

### Planning Phase

1. **Create meeting** with basic information
2. **Add participants** and set initial statuses
3. **Set recurrence pattern** if applicable
4. **Add notes** and preparation materials

### Execution Phase

1. **Send invitations** to participants
2. **Track responses** and update statuses
3. **Hold meeting** and record attendance
4. **Add instance notes** and follow-up items

### Follow-up Phase

1. **Review meeting outcomes** and decisions
2. **Create action items** and assign responsibilities
3. **Schedule follow-up meetings** if needed
4. **Update recurring series** based on feedback

## Best Practices
