Feedback campaigns provide a structured way to collect comprehensive feedback from multiple sources about team members, enabling 360‑degree reviews, performance evaluations, and pulse surveys.

This topic focuses on **how campaigns are configured, how responses are collected, and how to interpret and use the results**.

---

## Setting Up Effective Campaigns

### Basic configuration

When creating or editing a campaign you can set:

- **Campaign name** – descriptive title for the feedback cycle.
- **Target person** – the individual receiving feedback.
- **Template** – pre‑defined or custom question sets.
- **Date range** – start and end dates for responses.
- **Status** – \`draft\`, \`active\`, \`completed\`, or \`cancelled\`.

Good defaults:

- Start in **Draft** while you confirm participants and questions.
- Move to **Active** once you’re ready to send invites.

### Managing participants

You control who is invited to respond:

- Add an **invite list** of feedback providers.
- Use **roles** to ensure a balanced mix:
  - Manager(s)
  - Peers and cross‑functional partners
  - Direct reports
  - External stakeholders (when relevant)
- Decide if responses should be **anonymous** or identified.

### Using templates

Templates help you:

- Reuse consistent **question sets** across cycles.
- Mix **rating scales** with open‑ended questions.
- Tailor questions to:
  - Performance reviews
  - 360s
  - Pulse checks

---

## Collecting Responses

### Invitations and reminders

For each campaign you can:

- Send **initial invite emails** with secure links to the form.
- Send **reminder emails** to non‑responders while the campaign is active.
- See, for each invitee:
  - When invites and reminders were sent.
  - Whether they have submitted a response.

Tips:

- Time invites so people have space to respond thoughtfully.
- Use 1–2 reminders, not continual nudges.

### The response experience

Responders see:

- A **user‑friendly**, mobile‑friendly form.
- Progress indicators for longer surveys.
- Clear messaging about whether responses are **anonymous**.

Encourage:

- **Specific examples** instead of vague statements.
- A **balanced view** (strengths and growth areas).

### Managing responses

As responses come in you can:

- Track completion in real time.
- Prevent duplicates (one response per invite).
- Handle anonymous responses appropriately.

## Analyzing Feedback

### What data is captured

Behind the scenes, responses include:

- Ratings and text answers to each question.
- **Timestamps** and metadata.
- Participant identity (when not anonymous).
- Campaign and target person context.

### How to read the results

Use the campaign detail views to:

- Look at **rating distributions** and averages.
- Review **open‑ended comments** for patterns.
- Compare themes across respondent groups (e.g. peers vs. reports).

When synthesizing:

- Focus on **recurring themes**, not single comments.
- Separate:
  - Observations about **impact and behavior**.
  - Suggestions about **style or preferences**.
- Capture 3–5 key strengths and 2–3 focus areas.

---

## Privacy, Security, and Trust

### Data protection

Feedback data is:

- Stored securely with **encryption**.
- Governed by **role‑based access** controls.
- Tracked via **audit trails** where required.

Campaigns should be designed in line with your org’s privacy and HR policies.

### Anonymity

When you enable anonymity:

- Individual responses are **de‑identified** in views shared with the recipient.
- Reports may use **aggregated** data and minimum response thresholds.
- You should avoid sharing highly identifying quotes without care.

### Compliance

mpath supports:

- Data minimization and retention practices.
- Rights to deletion and access where required (e.g. GDPR contexts).

Always check with your HR/legal partners for org‑specific requirements.

---

## From Responses to Action

### Designing follow‑up

After a campaign closes:

1. Summarize themes for each recipient.
2. Share the summary in a **1:1 or performance conversation**.
3. Co‑create:
   - 1–3 focus areas.
   - Concrete actions and support.
   - Timeframes for revisiting progress.

### Integrating with other systems

Feedback results can inform:

- **Performance reviews** and calibration.
- **Goal setting** and development plans.
- **Succession and promotion** decisions.
- **Team‑level interventions** (training, coaching, process changes).

Use feedback as _one input_ alongside:

- Outcomes and impact (initiatives, tasks).
- Your own observations.
- Synopses and reports.

---

## Troubleshooting and Good Practices

### If response rates are low

- Re‑check:
  - Timing (avoid peak load periods).
  - Length and complexity of the survey.
  - How clearly you communicated **why** the feedback matters.

### If responses are low quality

- Adjust templates to:
  - Ask for **examples**.
  - Focus on **specific situations**.
  - Reduce overly generic questions.

### Quick best practices

- **Be transparent** – tell people how feedback will be used and who will see it.
- **Close the loop** – share themes and actions with both recipients and, when appropriate, respondents.
- **Use campaigns sparingly but meaningfully** – a few well‑run campaigns beat constant noise.
