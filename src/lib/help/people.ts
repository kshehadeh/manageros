The People page is your **source of truth for who is in your organization, how they’re connected, and what they’re working on**.

It’s where you go to answer questions like:

- “Who owns this initiative?”  
- “Who does this person report to?”  
- “What is this engineer currently involved in?”

---

## Overview

The People page shows all members of your organization in a **searchable, filterable table** and is deeply connected to the rest of mpath:

- Each person has a **profile** that ties together:
  - Reporting relationships
  - Tasks and initiatives
  - Meetings, feedback, and synopses
  - Integrations (GitHub, Jira, etc.)
- Managers and admins can see both **team‑level** and **org‑wide** views.

---

## Why the People Page Matters (Benefits)

- **Faster answers during reviews and planning**  
  Quickly pull up a person’s context when talking about performance, staffing, or load.

- **Clearer ownership and accountability**  
  See who leads what, who reports to whom, and where there might be gaps.

- **Better cross‑team collaboration**  
  Find the right people across teams when initiatives or incidents span org boundaries.

- **Stronger people decisions**  
  Use a combination of hierarchy, workload, and feedback to decide where to invest.

## Key Concepts

### People table

The table shows for each person:

- Name and basic contact info
- Role and team
- Status (e.g. active)
- Quick access to their **profile** and **chart position**

You can:

- Sort and filter by team, role, or other attributes
- Search by name to jump directly to someone

### Person profile

Clicking a person opens their profile, which can include:

- **Personal info** and contact details
- **Job role** and team assignments
- **Reporting chain** (manager and direct reports)
- **Initiatives** and **tasks** they’re involved in
- **Meetings** (including one‑on‑ones)
- **Feedback**, **synopses**, and other context

### Chart view

From People you can jump to the **org chart**:

- Visualizes reporting lines and team structure
- Lets you navigate up/down the hierarchy quickly

## How to Use the People Page in Practice

### 1. During performance and growth conversations

Before a review, promotion, or growth conversation:

1. Open the person’s profile from the **People** page.
2. Review:
   - Their **initiatives**, **tasks**, and key responsibilities
   - Relevant **feedback** and **synopses**
   - Their position in the **hierarchy** (span of control, peers)
3. Use this as factual grounding for your discussion.

### 2. When planning staffing and ownership

Use People + org chart to:

- See who’s currently on which **team**.
- Check who owns which **initiatives** and how stretched they are.
- Identify potential **successors** or co‑owners for critical work.

### 3. For day‑to‑day navigation

- Start from **People** when:
  - You remember the person but not the initiative name.
  - You want to see all the work and meetings around someone.
  - You need to find a manager or teammate quickly.

Use filters and search to zero in on the right slice of the org.

### 4. As an admin (managing the org)

Admins can:

- Add new people or bulk‑import via CSV.
- Maintain accurate **job roles** and team assignments.
- Keep reporting relationships in sync with reality.

This ensures that everything else in mpath (initiatives, tasks, meetings, reports) is grounded in a **correct org model**.

## Examples & Best Practices

### Example: Preparing for a 1:1

- From the People page, open your direct report’s profile.
- Review:
  - Current initiatives and tasks
  - Recent feedback or incidents
- Use that as input into your 1:1 agenda (see \`one-on-ones\`).

### Example: Spinning up a new initiative

- Filter by team and role to find potential owners.
- Use profiles to:
  - See what people are already working on
  - Avoid overloading the same person repeatedly

### Quick best practices

- **Keep profiles up to date** – title, team, and job role should reflect reality.
- **Use consistent naming** for roles and teams (see \`job-roles\`).
- **Rely on filters/search instead of side docs** for lists of people on a team.
