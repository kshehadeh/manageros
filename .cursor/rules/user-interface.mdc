# User Interface Rules

Entities like meetings, initiatives, people, etc. should follow these rules:

* The layout of the page should use available horizontal space
* When creating a series of action buttons for the entity detail page, prefer use an action drop down with an ellipsis button instead of separate buttons.
* Avoid using cards to surround groups of information.  Instead, use a page section with a header and appropriate spacing.
* Use breadcrumbs to navigate between pages using the useBreadcrumb hook and the Breadcrumb component with the client specific component.
* When displaying a list of entities, use the shadcn table component instead of a list of cards.  Limit the columns to those that are necessary and relevant to the entity.
* When creating a new table list, add support for filtering using the same UI as the persons table.  Where the filter button can be expanded to show the filters.  Support filtering based on the columns in the table unless it doesn't make sense for that property.
* We do not need to include a "Back to..." button since we have the breadcrumbs to navigate back to the previous page.

## Theming Rules

* Use the theme tokens for all colors.
* Read the docs/theming.md file for more information.

## Shadcn Rules

* Use the shadcn components for all UI.
* Read the components.json file for more information.

## Tailwind Rules

* Use the tailwind utility classes for all UI.
* Read the tailwind.config.ts file for more information.

## Forms

When creating forms, use the shadcn form components.
Only use cards when there is more than one section.  Each section can be in a card, but do not use a card if there's only a single section.

## Components

* Reuse components whenever possible.
* Look for other places where similar component are used and modify them to fit the new use case and reuse.  But weigh that against the complexity being introduced to satisfy this constraint.  If the complexity is too high, then create a new component.
