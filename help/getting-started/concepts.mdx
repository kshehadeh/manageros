## Core Concepts

mpath is built around a few key concepts that work together to help you manage your organization effectively.

  Individual members of your organization. People can belong to teams and have managers for structured reporting.
</Card>

<Card title="Teams" icon="users-round" href="/teams">
  Groups of people with a parent/child hierarchy. Teams own initiatives and can be nested for complex structures.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Work Management

Organize and track work at different levels of granularity.

## Meetings & Communication

Facilitate effective communication and collaboration.
