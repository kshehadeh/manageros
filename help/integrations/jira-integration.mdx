Jira integration lets mpath pull in **ticket work and project activity** so your view of execution covers both tasks and Jira issues.

It's especially useful when engineering teams live in Jira but managers want a **unified picture** across initiatives, tasks, and tickets.

---

## What You Get from the Jira Integration

With Jira connected you can:

- See a person's **assigned issues and progress** alongside their mpath tasks.
- Understand how work on **initiatives** spans Jira projects and issue types.
- Use Jira activity in:
  - Person Activity views.
  - Person Overview and AI Synopsis reports.
  - Initiative reviews and capacity discussions.

The goal is to **reduce tab‑switching** and bring Jira context into the same surface you're already using for people and initiatives.

## How to Set It Up (Step‑by‑Step)

### 1. Generate Jira API Token

Before configuring the integration in mpath, you'll need a Jira API token:

1. Log into your Jira instance.
2. Go to **Account Settings** → **Security** → **API tokens**.
3. Click **Create API token**.
4. Give it a label (e.g., "mpath Integration").
5. **Copy the token immediately** (it won't be shown again).

### 2. Configure Organization-Level Integration

<Warning>
  You must be an organization administrator to configure organization-level
  integrations.
</Warning>

1. Navigate to **Organization Settings** → **Integrations**.
2. Click **Add Integration**.
3. Select **Jira**.
4. Enter:
   - **Name**: A descriptive name (e.g., "Company Jira").
   - **Jira Username or Email**: Your Jira account email.
   - **Jira Base URL**: Your Jira instance URL (e.g., `https://yourcompany.atlassian.net`).
   - **API Token**: The token you generated in step 1.
5. Click **Create**.
6. The system will test the connection automatically.

<Info>
  Organization-level integrations allow all organization members to link their
  Jira accounts. User-level integrations are also available in **Settings** →
  **Integrations** for personal use.
</Info>

### 3. Link People to Their Jira Accounts

Once the organization-level integration is configured:

1. Open a person's profile in mpath.
2. Navigate to the **"Account Linking"** section.
3. In the Jira Account section, enter the person's **Jira email address**.
4. Click **"Link Account"**.

<Check>
  The Jira email must match an active Jira user in your Jira instance. If
  multiple users are found with the same email, contact your administrator.
</Check>

Once linked, mpath can attribute Jira issues to the right person and display their activity in Activity views.

## How Managers and Teams Use It

### For managers

- In person Activity views:
  - See **Jira issues** alongside tasks and initiatives.
  - Understand **where time is going** (feature work vs. bugs vs. interrupts).
- In reports:
  - Use Jira activity as part of the picture for reviews and planning.
- In AI Overview and synopses:
  - Get comprehensive insights that include Jira work activity.

### For engineers

- See all your work context in one place:
  - What you own in Jira.
  - How it ties back to initiatives and tasks in mpath.
- Use Activity views to:
  - Review your recent Jira work.
  - See how Jira tickets relate to mpath initiatives.

## Accessing Jira Data

### Activity Views

Jira activity appears in person Activity views:

1. Navigate to a person's profile.
2. Click the **"View"** dropdown menu.
3. Select **"Activity"**.
4. Scroll to the **Jira Metrics** section.

The Activity view shows:

- Assigned issues.
- Issue progress and status.
- Project activity within the selected date range.

### AI Overview and Synopses

Jira data is also included in:

- **AI Overview** reports for people.
- **AI-generated synopses** that synthesize work across all tools.

## Best Practices & Guardrails

### Security

- **Use fine-grained tokens** where possible.
- **Rotate API tokens regularly** and remove unused tokens.
- **Limit token scopes** to only what's needed.
- **Review linked accounts** periodically and unlink when people leave.

### Data Management

- **Use consistent naming** between Jira projects and mpath initiatives when possible.
- **Link accounts promptly** for new team members.
- **Keep links current** as people change roles or accounts.
- **Verify account links** are correct (wrong links show wrong data).

### Usage

- **Don't rely solely on metrics**—use Jira data as one input among many.
- **Respect privacy**—integration data should support, not replace, conversations.
- **Train the team** on:
  - What Jira data appears in mpath.
  - How it will be used (e.g., for planning, not micromanagement).

## Troubleshooting

### No Data Appearing

If Jira data isn't showing up:

1. **Check organization-level configuration**:
   - Verify integration is enabled in Organization Settings → Integrations.
   - Test the connection.
   - Confirm credentials are valid and not expired.

2. **Verify account linking**:
   - Ensure the person's account is linked.
   - Check that the email is correct.
   - Confirm the account exists in your Jira instance.

3. **Check date ranges**:
   - Activity views use date ranges—ensure your range includes recent activity.
   - Try expanding the date range.

4. **Review permissions**:
   - Verify the integration credentials have access to the data.
   - Check project permissions in Jira.

### Wrong Data Showing

If you see incorrect data:

1. **Verify account linking**:
   - Check that the linked account belongs to the correct person.
   - Unlink and re-link if necessary.

2. **Check for duplicate accounts**:
   - Some Jira instances may have multiple accounts for the same person.
   - Ensure you're linking to the correct account.

### Connection Issues

If the integration connection fails:

- Check that the Jira base URL is correct.
- Verify the API token is valid and not expired.
- Confirm the Jira username/email matches the token owner.
- Check Jira API status and your network connection.
