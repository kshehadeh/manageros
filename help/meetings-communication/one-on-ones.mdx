<Info>
  One‑on‑ones are your **most important recurring meeting** as a manager. They're where coaching, trust, and early risk detection actually happen.
</Info>

Handled well, they keep people engaged, aligned, and growing – not just "status updates."

## Why One‑on‑Ones Matter

### For Managers

<Tip>
  **Stay close to reality**  
  Hear about risks, blockers, and morale before they show up in metrics.
</Tip>

- **Coach, don't just assign**  
  Use the time to build judgment and autonomy, not to re‑do sprint planning.

- **Build trust and retention**  
  Consistent, high‑quality 1:1s are one of the strongest predictors of engagement.

### For Team Members

- **Dedicated space for them**  
  Time to talk about career, concerns, and ideas that don't fit into standups.

- **Clear priorities and expectations**  
  Align on what "good" looks like this week/quarter.

- **Regular feedback loop**  
  Both to receive coaching and to give feedback upward.

mpath makes 1:1s easier to run consistently and ties them into the rest of the system (people, tasks, feedback, initiatives).

## Key Concepts

### One‑on‑One Record

A 1:1 in mpath represents the **relationship and cadence** between a manager and a report:

- Who the manager and report are
- How often you meet (weekly, bi‑weekly, monthly, etc.)
- The history of notes, commitments, and topics

### Notes and Action Items

- Use notes to capture:
  - Themes over time (career goals, growth areas, strengths)
  - Specific commitments from each side
  - Follow‑ups for the next session
- Turn action items into **tasks** when they should appear in the day‑to‑day workflow.

### Links to Other Data

From a 1:1 you can quickly access:

- The person's **tasks**, **initiatives**, and **meetings**
- **Feedback** and **synopses** (where appropriate)
- Their place in the **people hierarchy**

This pulls everything into a single, coaching‑focused conversation.

## How to Run Effective One‑on‑Ones

### 1. Set Up the Relationship

1. Ensure the **manager ↔ report** relationship is correct in the people/teams setup.
2. Configure the **cadence** you want:
   - Weekly or bi‑weekly for most engineers
   - Monthly for senior ICs or leads who also meet in group forums
3. Make sure both sides know:
   - When the meeting is
   - What it's for
   - How to add topics

### 2. Prepare for the Session

Before each 1:1, quickly review:

- The person's **recent tasks** (especially blocked or high‑priority items)
- Any active **initiatives** they own or contribute to
- Recent **feedback** or report **synopses**

Skim previous 1:1 notes for:

- Open commitments
- Themes you're tracking (growth areas, stressors, goals)

### 3. Structure the Conversation

Use a simple flow:

1. **Their topics first**
   - "What's top of mind for you this week?"
2. **Work and execution**
   - Progress, blockers, support needed
   - How current work ties back to initiatives and goals
3. **Career and growth**
   - Skills to develop, opportunities, next steps
4. **Feedback both ways**
   - What's working / not working in your partnership

Capture key points and decisions in the 1:1 notes.

### 4. Turn Talk into Follow‑Through

At the end of the meeting:

- Summarize **3–5 concrete commitments**:
  - What they will do
  - What you will do
  - By when
- Create **tasks** for items that need to show up in execution:
  - Link them to the person and any relevant initiatives.
- At the next 1:1, start by reviewing how these commitments went.

## Examples & Best Practices

### Example: Early‑Career Engineer

- **Cadence**: Weekly 30 minutes
- **Focus**:
  - Clarifying priorities for the week
  - Unblocking tasks and pairing opportunities
  - Building confidence and communication patterns
- **In mpath**:
  - Review their tasks (status + priority).
  - Use initiatives to show how their work fits into bigger goals.
  - Capture growth areas and wins in the notes.

### Example: Senior IC or Tech Lead

- **Cadence**: Bi‑weekly or monthly, longer when needed
- **Focus**:
  - Initiative ownership and strategic impact
  - Cross‑team collaboration and influence
  - Long‑term career direction
- **In mpath**:
  - Use initiative pages as anchor material.
  - Connect 1:1 topics to feedback and reports.

### General Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Protect the time** – cancel only when absolutely necessary, and reschedule quickly.
</Tip>

- **Avoid turning 1:1s into status meetings only** – status is a starting point, not the whole agenda.
- **Write down commitments** – future you (and they) will thank you.
- **Use the system, not separate docs** – keep notes, tasks, and initiatives connected so 1:1s are grounded in reality, not memory.

## Integration with Other Features

### Tasks and Initiatives

- **Review recent tasks** before each 1:1 to understand current workload
- **Link action items** from 1:1s to relevant initiatives
- **Track follow-through** by reviewing task completion between sessions

### Feedback and Development

- **Reference feedback** received or given since the last 1:1
- **Use synopses** to track themes and patterns over time
- **Connect career discussions** to development opportunities

### People and Hierarchy

- **Understand reporting relationships** and team context
- **See related meetings** and other commitments
- **Access full person profile** for comprehensive context

## Common Patterns

### Weekly Check-ins

For most team members, weekly 1:1s provide:

- Regular touchpoint for alignment
- Quick blocker resolution
- Consistent feedback loop
- Relationship building

### Bi-Weekly or Monthly Sessions

For senior team members or leads:

- More strategic focus
- Longer time blocks for deeper discussions
- Initiative and career planning emphasis
- Cross-functional collaboration topics

### Ad-Hoc Sessions

Sometimes you need to schedule additional 1:1s for:

- Performance conversations
- Career planning discussions
- Conflict resolution
- Special project check-ins

## Troubleshooting

### When 1:1s Feel Rushed

- **Extend duration** if consistently running over
- **Reduce status updates** – use async channels for routine updates
- **Focus on priorities** – not everything needs discussion

### When Topics Feel Stale

- **Review recent work** – tasks, initiatives, feedback
- **Ask open-ended questions** – "What's challenging you right now?"
- **Connect to bigger picture** – link daily work to goals and initiatives

### When Follow-Through Lags

- **Create tasks immediately** during or right after the 1:1
- **Review commitments** at the start of the next session
- **Link tasks to initiatives** so they appear in regular workflows
