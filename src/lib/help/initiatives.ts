Initiatives are the **big rocks** in your organization – strategic efforts that pull together people, tasks, and goals around a shared outcome.

Use initiatives when you want to:

- Keep a **quarterly or multi-sprint effort** visible and on track
- Tie day‑to‑day tasks back to **clear objectives and outcomes**
- Give teams and stakeholders a **single source of truth** for status, risk, and ownership

---

## Overview

An initiative in mpath represents a **strategic project, OKR, or program**. It brings together:

- **Objectives** – what success looks like
- **Owners & team** – who is accountable and involved
- **Tasks** – the execution work that moves the initiative forward
- **Status, RAG, confidence** – how healthy and likely to succeed it is

Typical examples:

- “Ship v2 of the onboarding experience”
- “Reduce infra costs by 20%”
- “Improve time‑to‑resolution for P1 incidents”

---

## Why Initiatives Matter (Benefits)

- **Connect strategy to execution**  
  See how individual tasks and objectives roll up into a bigger outcome.

- **Create a shared narrative for leadership**  
  Use a single page to talk about status, risk, and confidence instead of scattered docs and spreadsheets.

- **Clarify ownership**  
  Make it obvious who is accountable, who’s involved, and which team is driving the work.

- **Focus attention where it matters**  
  RAG status and confidence make it easy to spot initiatives that need support before they go off the rails.

- **Support recurring reviews**  
  Use initiatives as the backbone for weekly, bi‑weekly, or monthly check‑ins with leads and stakeholders.

## Key Concepts

### Initiative

A container for a strategic effort. An initiative has:

- **Title & summary** – what you’re doing and why
- **Outcome** – the primary result you’re aiming for (e.g. “NPS > 50”)
- **Dates** – when the initiative starts and when you’re aiming to finish
- **Status** – \`planning\`, \`in_progress\`, \`on_hold\`, \`completed\`, or \`cancelled\`
- **RAG** – health indicator (\`red\`, \`amber\`, \`green\`)
- **Confidence** – 1–10 sense of how likely you are to hit the outcome

### Objectives

Objectives break the initiative into **measurable chunks of progress**:

- Each objective has a **title** and optional **key result**
- They act like **mini‑goals** within the initiative (e.g. “Improve DB performance – p95 < 100ms”)
- They help frame discussions in check‑ins (“Which objectives are at risk?”)

### Owners & Team

- **Owners** are specific people accountable for the initiative’s success (engineering lead, PM, EM, etc.)
- You can add multiple owners with roles like \`owner\`, \`tech lead\`, or \`product\`
- Initiatives can also be linked to a **team**, which anchors the work to an org unit

### Tasks

Tasks are the **execution layer**:

- Concrete work items that connect to an initiative and/or its objectives
- They carry status, priority, and assignees  
  (see the \`task-status\` and \`task-priorities\` help topics for more detail)

## How to Use Initiatives (Step‑by‑Step)

### 1. Create a new initiative

1. Go to the **Initiatives** section.
2. Click **New initiative**.
3. Fill in:
   - **Title** – clear and specific (e.g. “Q4 Platform Resilience Upgrade”)
   - **Summary** – 1–3 sentences describing the scope
   - **Outcome** – the result you care about (latency, NPS, revenue, etc.)
   - **Dates** – realistic start and target dates
   - **Status** – usually \`planning\` or \`in_progress\` when you create it
   - **RAG & confidence** – your honest starting point
4. Save the initiative – this becomes the home for related objectives and tasks.

### 2. Add objectives with clear key results

1. From the initiative detail page, add **Objectives**.
2. For each objective, define:
   - A **title** (e.g. “Reduce p95 API latency”)
   - An optional **key result** (e.g. “p95 < 150ms for top 10 endpoints”)
3. Aim for **3–5 objectives** per initiative – enough to cover the work but still focused.

### 3. Assign owners and (optionally) a team

1. Add one or more **owners**:
   - Use roles like \`owner\`, \`tech lead\`, \`PM\`, or \`EM\` to clarify responsibilities.
2. If the initiative belongs to a specific org unit, link a **team**:
   - This makes it easier to filter initiatives across the org.

### 4. Link tasks to the initiative

1. When creating or editing tasks, link them to the relevant **initiative** (and objective where applicable).
2. Use task status and priority to keep execution clear:
   - \`status\` shows where the work sits in the lifecycle (see \`task-status\`).
   - \`priority\` shows what should move first when schedules get tight (see \`task-priorities\`).
3. In reviews, start from the initiative and drill into tasks that are blocked or at risk.

### 5. Run regular check‑ins

1. On your **initiative detail** page, review:
   - Overall **status**, **RAG**, and **confidence**
   - Progress on each **objective**
   - Recently updated or blocked **tasks**
2. Adjust as needed:
   - Update status/RAG/confidence to reflect reality.
   - Add or re‑prioritize objectives if the scope shifts.
   - Reassign or clarify ownership when responsibilities change.
3. Use this page as the shared artifact in your **weekly / bi‑weekly reviews** with leads and stakeholders.

## Examples & Best Practices

### Example: Shipping a new feature set

- **Initiative**: “Launch self‑serve onboarding for SMEs”
- **Outcome**: “Increase self‑serve signups by 30%”
- **Objectives**:
  - “Reduce time‑to‑value for new workspaces”
  - “Improve onboarding completion to 90%”
  - “Reduce support tickets for new users by 25%”
- **Tasks**:
  - Design flows, implement backend, instrument analytics, update docs
- **Usage**:
  - Weekly review with PM + EM: check RAG, confidence, and tasks that didn’t move.

### Example: Operational improvement initiative

- **Initiative**: “Improve incident response”
- **Outcome**: “Cut P1 MTTR in half”
- **Objectives**:
  - “Standardize runbooks for top 10 incident types”
  - “Reduce alert noise by 40%”
  - “Train all on‑call engineers on new process”
- **Best practices**:
  - Make the **outcome measurable**.
  - Tie initiatives into **meetings** (e.g. weekly ops review) so it’s regularly inspected.

### General best practices

- **Start with the outcome**  
  Write the outcome first, then add objectives and tasks that support it.

- **Update RAG and confidence before reviews**  
  This keeps conversations focused on what changed and why.

- **Limit the number of active initiatives per team**  
  Too many “important” things means nothing is truly important.

- **Close out completed or cancelled initiatives**  
  Use \`completed\` or \`cancelled\` so dashboards stay accurate and historical work stays readable.
