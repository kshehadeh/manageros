# Task Priorities

Task priorities help you and your team focus on what matters most. ManagerOS uses a simple but effective priority system:

## Priority Levels

### ðŸ”´ High Priority

- **Critical tasks** that need immediate attention
- **Deadline-driven** work with tight timelines
- **Blocking issues** that prevent other work

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority

- **Important tasks** that should be completed soon
- **Regular work** that contributes to goals
- **Supporting activities** for high-priority items

### ðŸŸ¢ Low Priority

- **Nice-to-have** tasks when time permits
- **Future planning** and preparation work
- **Optional improvements** and enhancements

## Best Practices

- **Limit high-priority tasks** to 3-5 items maximum
- **Review priorities weekly** and adjust as needed
- **Communicate changes** to stakeholders when priorities shift
- **Use deadlines** to help determine priority levels
