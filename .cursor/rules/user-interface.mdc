# User Interface Rules

## Theming Rules

* Use the theme tokens for all colors.
* Read the docs/theming.md file for more information.

## Shadcn Rules

* Use the shadcn components for all UI.
* Read the components.json file for more information.

## Tailwind Rules

* Use the tailwind utility classes for all UI.
* Read the tailwind.config.ts file for more information.

## Forms

When creating forms, use the shadcn form components.
Only use cards when there is more than one section.  Each section can be in a card, but do not use a card if there's only a single section.

## Components

* Reuse components whenever possible.
* Look for other places where similar component are used and modify them to fit the new use case and reuse.  But weigh that against the complexity being introduced to satisfy this constraint.  If the complexity is too high, then create a new component.
