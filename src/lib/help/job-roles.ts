Job roles in mpath describe **what a position is, how senior it is, and which domain it belongs to**.  
They give you a consistent language for hiring, career growth, and organizational analysis.

---

## Overview

Job roles are built from three core pieces:

- **Job levels** – how senior the role is (e.g. Junior, Senior, Staff)
- **Job domains** – which functional area it belongs to (e.g. Engineering, Product, Design)
- **Role definitions** – how those come together into a specific position (e.g. Senior Software Engineer)

Once defined, job roles can be **assigned to people** and used across:

- The **People** view
- Org planning and career frameworks
- Performance and calibration workflows

---

## Why Job Roles Matter (Benefits)

- **Clarity for people and managers**  
  Everyone understands what a role means, how it’s expected to operate, and what “next level” looks like.

- **Consistency in hiring and promotion**  
  Candidates and internal moves are evaluated against the same expectations.

- **Better reporting and planning**  
  You can see how many people you have at each level and in each domain.

---

## Key Concepts

### Job levels

Levels represent **seniority and scope**. For example:

- Junior → entry‑level roles
- Professional → core individual contributors
- Senior Professional → experienced ICs with broader scope
- Staff / Principal → strategic technical leaders

Levels are **ordered**, so they appear in a consistent progression in dropdowns and reports.

### Job domains

Domains represent **functional areas**, such as:

- Engineering
- Product
- Design
- Marketing

Domains help you slice the org by function and understand where skills sit.

### Job roles

A job role combines **level + domain + description** into a concrete position:

- “Senior Software Engineer” (Senior, Engineering)
- “Staff Product Manager” (Staff, Product)
- “UX Designer” (multiple levels, Design)

Each role can have:

- Responsibilities
- Requirements
- Growth expectations

---

## How to Manage Job Roles in mpath

### 1. As an administrator: set up levels and domains

1. Go to **Organization Settings → Job Role Management**.
2. Create **job levels**:
   - Add entries like “Junior”, “Senior”, “Staff”.
   - Drag and drop to set ordering (from least to most senior).
3. Create **job domains**:
   - Add functional areas like “Engineering”, “Product”, “Design”.

### 2. Create job roles

1. In the Job Roles section, click **Add Job Role**.
2. Fill in:
   - **Title** – the role name (e.g. “Senior Software Engineer”).
   - **Level** – selected from the levels you defined.
   - **Domain** – selected from your domains.
   - **Description** – responsibilities, expectations, and requirements (supports markdown).
3. Save – roles become available everywhere a **job role** can be selected.

### 3. Assign roles to people

You can assign job roles when:

- **Creating a new person** from the People page.
- **Editing an existing person’s** profile.

This keeps people data, hierarchy, and career paths aligned.

## Examples & Best Practices

### Example: Building an engineering ladder

- Levels: Junior → Professional → Senior Professional → Staff → Principal.
- Domains: Engineering, Product, Design.
- Roles:
  - “Software Engineer” (Professional, Engineering)
  - “Senior Software Engineer” (Senior Professional, Engineering)
  - “Staff Software Engineer” (Staff, Engineering)

Use descriptions to capture:

- Responsibilities and expected scope
- Technical and leadership expectations
- Signals for readiness to move to the next level

### Example: Planning hiring for next year

- Use job roles to:
  - See how many people you have at each level in each domain.
  - Spot gaps (e.g. missing Staff‑level engineers in key domains).
  - Plan which roles to open for hiring.

### Quick best practices

- **Keep role descriptions current** – update when expectations change.
- **Review levels and roles periodically** with HR/people ops.
- **Use roles consistently in performance and calibration**, so evaluation criteria are clear.

# Job Roles and Organizational Structure

## Overview

Job Roles provide structured definitions of positions within your organization. They combine job levels, domains, and detailed descriptions to create a comprehensive organizational hierarchy.

## Key Concepts

### Job Levels

Job levels represent seniority within your organization and can be organized in a hierarchy:

- **Junior** - Entry-level positions (order: 0)
- **Professional** - Individual contributors (order: 1)
- **Senior Professional** - Experienced individual contributors (order: 2)
- **Staff** - Senior contributors with mentoring responsibilities (order: 3)
- **Principal** - Technical leaders and architecture (order: 4)

**Level Ordering**: Job levels are displayed in order from lowest to highest. This order determines how levels appear in selection dropdowns and helps establish clear career progression paths.

### Job Domains

Job domains represent functional areas:

- **Engineering** - Software development and technical roles
- **Product** - Product management and strategy
- **Design** - User experience and visual design
- **Marketing** - Marketing and communications

### Job Roles

Job roles combine levels and domains into specific positions:

- **Senior Software Engineer** (Senior Level, Engineering Domain)
- **Product Manager** (Multiple Levels, Product Domain)
- **UX Designer** (Multiple Levels, Design Domain)

## Managing Job Roles

### As an Administrator

1. **Navigate to Organization Settings**
   - Go to Organization Settings in the sidebar (admin only)
   - Find the "Job Role Management" section

2. **Create Job Levels**
   - Click "Add Level" in the Job Levels section
   - Enter level name (e.g., "Senior", "Staff")
   - Click "Create" to save
   - New levels automatically receive the next order number

3. **Order Job Levels**
   - Drag and drop levels to reorder them
   - Order numbers automatically update based on position
   - Levels appear in selection dropdowns based on their order
   - Use the grip handle (⋮⋮) to drag levels up or down

4. **Create Job Domains**
   - Click "Add Domain" in the Job Domains section
   - Enter domain name (e.g., "Engineering", "Product")
   - Click "Create" to save

5. **Create Job Roles**
   - Click "Add Job Role" in the Job Roles section
   - Fill in the job title (e.g., "Senior Software Engineer")
   - Select a level from the dropdown
   - Select a domain from the dropdown
   - Write a job description using markdown
   - Click "Create" to save

### Editing and Deleting

- **Edit**: Click the "Edit" button next to any level, domain, or role
- **Delete**: Click the "Delete" button (only allowed if no roles/people are assigned)
- **Safety**: You cannot delete levels or domains that have job roles assigned, or job roles that have people assigned

### Drag-and-Drop Ordering

Job levels support intuitive drag-and-drop reordering:

- **Visual Indicators**: Each level shows a grip handle (⋮⋮) for dragging
- **Smooth Animation**: Visual feedback during drag operations with shadow effects
- **Automatic Persistence**: New order is automatically saved to the database
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes reflect immediately in job role forms and selections
