The Person Overview Report is your **“show me the data” view of someone’s work** over a period of time.

It pulls together tasks, initiatives, integrations, and (optionally) feedback into a structured report you can read or share.

---

## When to Use the Person Overview Report

Use this report when you need:

- A **detailed picture** of what someone has been doing (not just a few highlights).
- Evidence for **performance reviews, promotions, or calibration**.
- To understand how someone’s work is **distributed across initiatives and projects**.
- To check for **capacity, load, or focus issues** over time.

If you want a shorter, narrative‑style summary instead, see the \`ai-synopsis-report\`.

## What the Report Includes

Depending on what’s connected, a Person Overview can include:

- **Task activity**
  - Completed tasks in the chosen date range.
  - Status distribution (To Do, Doing, Blocked, Done, Dropped).
  - Priority mix and links to initiatives.

- **Initiative involvement**
  - Which initiatives and objectives they contributed to.
  - How tasks are spread across initiatives.

- **GitHub and Jira activity** (if linked)
  - Pull requests created/reviewed/merged.
  - Tickets assigned and completed.
  - Distribution across repositories/projects and issue types.

- **Feedback (optional)**
  - High‑level summary of feedback campaigns included in the range.

This gives you both **quantitative metrics** (counts, distributions) and **context** (where the work is happening).

## How to Run the Report (Step‑by‑Step)

1. Go to the **Reports** section.
2. Select **Person Overview**.
3. Configure:
   - **Person** – who you want to analyze.
   - **From / To dates** – the analysis window (e.g. quarter, sprint cycle).
   - **Include feedback** – whether to bring in feedback data.
4. Run the report and open the generated instance.

Tips:

- For performance reviews, use the **full review period** (e.g. last quarter/half).
- For check‑ins, use **smaller windows** (2–6 weeks) to keep things focused.

## How to Read and Use the Report

### For reviews and promotion discussions

- Look at:
  - **Volume and type of work** – what they did and where.
  - **Initiative spread** – are they spread thin or focused?
  - **Patterns over time** – bursts of work, long‑running efforts, etc.
- Combine with:
  - \`synopsis-generation\` / \`ai-synopsis-report\` for narrative summaries.
  - Feedback campaign results for perception and behavior signals.
  - Your own 1:1 notes and observations.

### For coaching and development

- Use the report in 1:1s to:
  - Show how work lines up with **career goals** and expectations.
  - Highlight **impactful initiatives** and **visible contributions**.
  - Spot areas where they might take more ownership or breadth.

### For workload and capacity checks

- Scan:
  - Number and mix of tasks.
  - Initiative load and cross‑team work.
  - Ticket/PR volume (when integrated).
- Use this to:
  - Adjust staffing across initiatives.
  - Balance work across team members.

## Access and Permissions (Summary)

- **Self‑access** – people can generate overviews for themselves (their linked person record).
- **Managers** – can generate overviews for their direct reports.
- **Admins** – can generate overviews for anyone in the organization.

All data is:

- Scoped to your **organization**.
- Respectful of **feedback privacy** (private feedback remains limited to authors).
