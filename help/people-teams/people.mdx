<Info>
  The People page is your **source of truth** for who's in your organization, how they're connected, and what they're working on. Think of it as your organization's directory—but way smarter.
</Info>

Ever find yourself asking questions like:
- "Who owns this initiative?"
- "Who does this person report to?"
- "What is this engineer currently involved in?"

The People section is where you'll find those answers, fast.

## What You'll Find Here

The People section provides multiple views to help you understand and manage your organization. Use the **View** dropdown in the header to switch between different perspectives:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Dashboard View" icon="layout-dashboard">
  Get an overview of your organization with statistics cards and breakdown charts showing people distribution by status, team, and job role.
</Card>

<Card title="List View" icon="list">
  Browse everyone in your organization in a searchable, filterable table with advanced grouping and sorting options.
</Card>

<Card title="Direct Reports" icon="user-check">
  Quickly access and manage your direct reports with a focused view (managers only).
</Card>

<Card title="Organizational Chart" icon="workflow">
  Visualize your entire organization structure with an interactive hierarchy view.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Why This Matters

You might be wondering: "Why do I need a dedicated People section?" Here's why it's so valuable:

<Tip>
  **Faster answers during reviews and planning**  
  When you're preparing for a performance review or planning session, you can quickly pull up someone's complete context—their workload, recent feedback, and key responsibilities—without jumping between different pages.
</Tip>

- **Clearer ownership and accountability**  
  See who leads what, who reports to whom, and where there might be gaps in your organization structure.

- **Better cross-team collaboration**  
  When initiatives or incidents span multiple teams, you can quickly find the right people across your entire organization.

- **Stronger people decisions**  
  Combine hierarchy, workload, and feedback data to make informed decisions about where to invest your team's time and energy.

## Switching Between Views

All People views are accessible through the **View** dropdown menu in the page header. This dropdown appears on every People page, making it easy to switch perspectives:

- **Dashboard** - Overview with statistics and charts
- **List** - Searchable, filterable table of all people
- **Direct Reports** - Focused view of your direct reports (managers only)
- **Organizational Chart** - Visual hierarchy of your organization

<Tip>
  The View dropdown highlights which view you're currently on, making it easy to know where you are and switch to another view when needed.
</Tip>

## Understanding the People Views

Each view is optimized for different tasks. Here's what you'll find in each:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Dashboard View">

The Dashboard view provides a high-level overview of your organization with key metrics and visualizations:

**Statistics Cards:**
- **Total People** - Click to jump to the List view showing everyone in your organization
- **Direct Reports** - Shows how many people report directly to you (managers only)
- **1:1s Needed** - Highlights direct reports who haven't had a recent one-on-one meeting
- **360s Needed** - Shows direct reports who need recent 360 feedback campaigns

**Breakdown Charts:**
- **Status Breakdown** - Pie chart showing distribution of people by status (Active, Inactive, On Leave, Terminated)
- **Team Breakdown** - Bar chart visualizing how people are distributed across teams
- **Job Role Breakdown** - Pie chart showing the distribution of job roles in your organization

<Tip>
  Click on any statistics card to drill down into the details. For example, clicking "1:1s Needed" opens a modal showing which direct reports need attention.
</Tip>

This view is perfect for getting a quick pulse on your organization and identifying areas that need attention.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="List View">

The List view is a powerful, searchable table that shows everyone in your organization. It's designed for finding people quickly and understanding your team structure.

**What you'll see:**
- **Name and contact info** - Each person's name, avatar, and email address
- **Team** - Which team they belong to
- **Manager** - Who they report to
- **Role** - Their job role title
- **Status** - Whether they're active, on leave, etc.
- **Quick actions** - Access actions menu for each person

**Powerful features:**
- **Search** - Type to find people by name or email
- **Filtering** - Filter by team, manager, job role, or status
- **Direct Reports toggle** - Quickly filter to show only your direct reports (if you're a manager)
- **Grouping** - Group the table by team, manager, job role, or status to see patterns
- **Sorting** - Sort by name, status, or team
- **Column visibility** - Show or hide columns based on what you need

You can click on any person's name or row to open their detailed profile.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Direct Reports View">

The Direct Reports view is a focused view that shows only your direct reports. This view is automatically filtered to show active people who report directly to you.

**When to use it:**
- Quickly check in on your team
- See who needs attention (1:1s, feedback, etc.)
- Manage your direct reports without filtering

<Tip>
  This view is only available if you have a linked person record and direct reports. If you don't see this option, you may need to link your user account to a person record.
</Tip>

The table includes all the same features as the List view (search, filter, group, sort) but is pre-filtered to your team.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Organizational Chart">

The Organizational Chart (also called the hierarchy view) transforms your organization into a visual chart that shows:

- **Reporting relationships** - See who reports to whom (manager → direct reports) at a glance
- **Team and org structure** - Understand how teams are organized and connected
- **Navigation paths** - Move up and down the chain to explore relationships

**How to navigate the org chart:**

1. **Start from a known person** - Begin with yourself or your manager
2. **Move up** - See your leadership chain and understand who's above you
3. **Move down** - Explore teams and sub-teams to see the full structure

This is especially helpful in:
- Large organizations where it's hard to keep track of everyone
- Matrixed environments with many teams and cross-functional relationships

<Tip>
  The visual nature of the chart makes it much easier to understand relationships than scrolling through a list. New managers and individual contributors can quickly see "who's who" without digging through scattered docs.
</Tip>

Perfect for understanding relationships, planning organizational changes, and onboarding new team members.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Person Profiles">

When you click on someone from any view, you open their profile—and this is where the magic happens. Each profile brings together:

- **Personal info** and contact details
- **Job role** and team assignments
- **Reporting chain** - See their manager and direct reports at a glance
- **Work context** - All their initiatives and tasks in one view
- **Communication** - Meetings (including one-on-ones) and feedback
- **Integrations** - Activity from GitHub, Jira, and other connected tools
- **Synopses** - AI-generated summaries of their work and contributions

Think of it as a dashboard for that person—everything you need to know about them is right there.

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How to Use It Day-to-Day

Here are the most common ways you'll use the People page:

<Steps>
<Step title="During performance and growth conversations">

Before a review, promotion, or growth conversation, the People section is your prep tool:

1. Use the **List view** or **Direct Reports view** to find the person
2. Open their profile
2. Review their complete context:
   - Current initiatives and tasks
   - Recent feedback and synopses
   - Their position in the hierarchy (who they manage, who their peers are)
3. Use this as factual grounding for your discussion

<Check>
  Having concrete data about someone's work and contributions makes these conversations more objective and productive.
</Check>

</Step>

<Step title="When planning staffing and ownership">

Use the People Dashboard, List view, and org chart together to make smart staffing decisions:

- See who's currently on which team
- Check who owns which initiatives and how stretched they are
- Understand spans of control and team sizes at a glance
- Identify potential successors or co-owners for critical work
- Spot gaps in coverage before they become problems
- See if a manager is overloaded or if a team needs more support

This helps you balance workloads and ensure important work has clear ownership.

</Step>

<Step title="Navigating the org chart">

The org chart (hierarchy view) is perfect for exploring your organization structure:

1. **Start from a known person** - Begin with yourself or your manager
2. **Move up** - See your leadership chain and understand who's above you
3. **Move down** - Explore teams and sub-teams to see the full structure

When working on cross-team initiatives:
- Use the chart to identify managers and leads for involved teams
- Understand who may need to be consulted or informed
- Combine with the People and Initiatives views to see who owns which work and where dependencies live

This helps you map out communication and coordination needs before you start.

</Step>

<Step title="For everyday navigation">

The People section is often the fastest way to find what you need:

- **Start with the Dashboard** - Get a quick overview of your organization's health
- **Switch to List view** - When you need to find someone specific, use search and filters
- **Use Direct Reports view** - Managers can quickly check in on their team
- **Explore the Org Chart** - Understand relationships and structure visually

**Quick tips:**
- **You remember the person but not the initiative name?** Start with People List view and search
- **Want to see all the work and meetings around someone?** Their profile has it all
- **Need to find a manager or teammate quickly?** Use the List view and filter by team
- **Want to see who needs attention?** Check the Dashboard view for "1:1s Needed" and "360s Needed" cards

Use the View dropdown to switch between perspectives based on what you're trying to accomplish.

</Step>

<Step title="As an admin: keeping things accurate">

If you're an admin, the People section is where you maintain your organization's foundation:

- Add new people or bulk-import via CSV
  - Use the **name** column as the key when importing
  - Include only the fields you want to change—blank cells leave existing data in place
  - Import birthdays in `YYYY-MM-DD` format to power upcoming birthday reminders
- Maintain accurate job roles and team assignments
- Keep reporting relationships in sync with reality

<Warning>
  Keeping your org structure accurate is critical. Everything else in mpath—initiatives, tasks, meetings, reports—depends on having the right people in the right places.
</Warning>

</Step>
</Steps>

## Real-World Examples

Let's see how this works in practice:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Preparing for a 1:1">

You have a 1:1 coming up with a direct report. Here's how to prepare:

1. Check the **Dashboard view** - Look at the "1:1s Needed" card to see which reports need attention
2. Use the **Direct Reports view** - Quickly access your team member
3. Open their profile to review:
   - Current initiatives and tasks
   - Recent feedback or any incidents
   - Their position in the hierarchy
4. Use this context to build your 1:1 agenda

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Finding an owner for a new initiative">

You're spinning up a new initiative and need to find the right owner:

1. Start with the **Dashboard view** to see team and role distributions
2. Switch to the **List view** and filter by team and role
3. Open profiles of potential owners
4. Check what they're already working on
5. Avoid overloading the same person repeatedly

This helps you make informed decisions about who should own new work.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="New manager onboarding">

A new Engineering Manager joins and needs to understand their area quickly:

1. Open the org chart from the People page
2. Navigate to their position in the chart
3. See all their direct and indirect reports at a glance
4. Understand how their area fits into the broader organization

<Info>
  This visual overview is much faster than reading through org docs or asking multiple people. They can see the full picture immediately.
</Info>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Planning a reorganization">

You're considering restructuring your organization. The org chart helps you:

1. **Visualize current structure** - See spans of control and team sizes
2. **Identify potential issues** - Spot managers who might be overloaded or teams that are too small
3. **Simulate changes** - Think through how new structures would look before implementing them

This helps you make data-driven decisions about organizational changes.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Finding the right person for a cross-team initiative">

You're starting a new initiative that needs input from multiple teams:

1. Use the org chart to identify managers and leads for each involved team
2. See how teams connect and who reports to whom
3. Understand communication paths and decision-making structures
4. Identify who needs to be consulted or informed

This ensures you involve the right people from the start.

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

Here are some tips to get the most out of the People page:

<Tip>
  **Keep profiles up to date**  
  Make sure titles, teams, and job roles reflect reality. When someone gets promoted or moves teams, update their profile—it affects everything else in mpath.
</Tip>

- **Use consistent naming** for roles and teams. This makes filtering and searching much more effective. Check out the job roles guide for more on this.

- **Use the right view for the task** - Dashboard for overview, List for finding people, Direct Reports for team management, Org Chart for structure
- **Rely on filters and search** instead of maintaining separate docs. The People section is your source of truth—use it!

- **Keep the org chart up to date** - Outdated org charts create confusion quickly. When someone moves teams or gets a new manager, update it immediately. Set a reminder to review it quarterly.

- **Review structure periodically** - Set aside time (e.g., quarterly) to review the structure and make sure it still matches how work actually flows. Sometimes the org chart and reality drift apart.

- **Use the org chart for onboarding** - New team members can use the hierarchy to understand the organization quickly. It's a great first stop for anyone joining your team.
- **Check the Dashboard regularly** - Use the statistics cards to quickly identify who needs attention (1:1s, feedback) and understand your organization's composition
