GitHub integration brings **development work into the same place as people, initiatives, and tasks**.

It helps you see not just _that_ work is happening, but **where and how** engineers are contributing in code.

---

## What You Get from the GitHub Integration

With GitHub connected you can:

- See **recent pull requests** for linked people directly in mpath.
- Understand how work on **initiatives and tasks** shows up in code.
- Use PR activity as input into:
  - Performance reviews and promotion discussions.
  - Weekly team reviews and incident post‑mortems.
  - AI Overview and synopsis reports.

The goal is not to create a separate "metrics dashboard", but to **add GitHub context to the workflows you already use**.

## How to Set It Up (Step‑by‑Step)

### 1. Generate GitHub Personal Access Token

Before configuring the integration in mpath, you'll need a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT):

1. Go to [GitHub Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
2. Navigate to **Developer settings** → **Personal access tokens** → **Tokens (classic)**.
3. Click **Generate new token (classic)**.
4. Give it a name (e.g., "mpath Integration").
5. Select scopes:
   - `repo` - Full control of private repositories (if you need private repo access).
   - `read:user` - Read user profile data.
   - `read:org` - Read org and team membership (if you need organization data).
6. Click **Generate token**.
7. **Important**: Copy the token immediately (it won't be shown again).

<Tip>
  Use fine-grained tokens where possible for better security. Fine-grained tokens allow more granular permission control.
</Tip>

### 2. Configure Organization-Level Integration

<Warning>
  You must be an organization administrator to configure organization-level integrations.
</Warning>

1. Navigate to **Organization Settings** → **Integrations**.
2. Click **Add Integration**.
3. Select **GitHub**.
4. Enter:
   - **Name**: A descriptive name (e.g., "Company GitHub").
   - **GitHub Username**: Your GitHub username.
   - **Personal Access Token**: The PAT you generated in step 1.
5. Click **Create**.
6. The system will test the connection automatically.

<Info>
  Organization-level integrations allow all organization members to link their GitHub accounts. User-level integrations are also available in **Settings** → **Integrations** for personal use.
</Info>

### 3. Link People to Their GitHub Accounts

Once the organization-level integration is configured:

1. Open a person's profile in mpath.
2. Navigate to the **"Account Linking"** section.
3. In the GitHub Account section, enter the person's **GitHub username**.
4. Click **"Link Account"**.

<Check>
  The GitHub username must be valid and the account must be accessible with the configured integration credentials.
</Check>

Once linked:

- Their PR activity can appear in:
  - Person Activity views.
  - Person Overview and AI Synopsis reports.
  - Initiative views.

## How Engineers and Managers Use It Day‑to‑Day

### For engineers

- See your own **recent PRs** alongside tasks and initiatives in Activity views.
- Use this context in 1:1s and reviews to:
  - Recall which pieces of work shipped.
  - Talk about collaboration (reviews, cross‑repo work).
  - Show progress on initiatives through code contributions.

### For managers and leads

- When looking at a person or initiative:
  - See **where code is landing** (repos, services).
  - Understand the balance between **feature work, maintenance, and incident‑driven work**.
- Use GitHub data as:
  - One input to performance discussions (not the only one).
  - A way to recognize invisible work like reviews and refactors.
- In AI Overview and synopses:
  - Get comprehensive insights that include GitHub activity.

---

## Accessing GitHub Data

### Activity Views

GitHub activity appears in person Activity views:

1. Navigate to a person's profile.
2. Click the **"View"** dropdown menu.
3. Select **"Activity"**.
4. Scroll to the **GitHub Metrics** section.

The Activity view shows:
- Recent pull requests.
- Code contributions.
- Repository activity within the selected date range.

### AI Overview and Synopses

GitHub data is also included in:
- **AI Overview** reports for people.
- **AI-generated synopses** that synthesize work across all tools.

## Security & Best Practices

### Security

- **Keep tokens scoped and rotated**:
  - Use fine‑grained PATs or app‑based integrations where possible.
  - Rotate regularly and remove tokens when no longer needed.
- **Respect repo access**:
  - Only fetch data for repositories your org is comfortable surfacing.
  - Follow your internal security and privacy policies.
- **Review linked accounts**:
  - Link GitHub accounts promptly for new hires.
  - Unlink accounts when people leave the organization.

### Data Management

- **Link accounts promptly** for new team members.
- **Verify account links** are correct (wrong links show wrong data).
- **Keep links current** as people change roles or accounts.
- **Review integration data** regularly to ensure accuracy.

### Usage

- **Don't rely solely on metrics**—use GitHub data as one input among many.
- **Respect privacy**—integration data should support, not replace, conversations.
- **Recognize invisible work** like code reviews and refactoring that may not show up in PR counts.

## Troubleshooting

### No Data Appearing

If GitHub data isn't showing up:

1. **Check organization-level configuration**:
   - Verify integration is enabled in Organization Settings → Integrations.
   - Test the connection.
   - Confirm credentials are valid and not expired.

2. **Verify account linking**:
   - Ensure the person's account is linked.
   - Check that the username is correct.
   - Confirm the account exists and is accessible.

3. **Check date ranges**:
   - Activity views use date ranges—ensure your range includes recent activity.
   - Try expanding the date range.

4. **Review permissions**:
   - Verify the integration credentials have access to the repositories.
   - Check repository permissions and GitHub API status.

### Wrong Data Showing

If you see incorrect data:

1. **Verify account linking**:
   - Check that the linked account belongs to the correct person.
   - Unlink and re-link if necessary.

2. **Check for duplicate accounts**:
   - Some people may have multiple GitHub accounts.
   - Ensure you're linking to the correct account.

### Connection Issues

If the integration connection fails:

- Check that the GitHub username is correct.
- Verify the Personal Access Token is valid and not expired.
- Confirm the token has the required scopes.
- Check GitHub API status and your network connection.

### Token Scopes

If you're missing data:

- Verify the token has `repo` scope for private repositories.
- Check that `read:user` and `read:org` scopes are included if needed.
- Review GitHub's token scope documentation for your use case.
