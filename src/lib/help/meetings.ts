Meetings in mpath give you a **single place to plan, run, and connect discussions to real work** – without losing context in scattered calendars and docs.

Use meetings when you want:

- A **repeatable rhythm** for check‑ins, reviews, or ceremonies
- Discussions that are **tied back to initiatives, objectives, and tasks**
- Clear **ownership, participation, and outcomes** for each session

---

## Overview

A meeting in mpath represents a **scheduled session** with:

- **Title & description** – what the meeting is about and why it exists
- **Date, time, and duration** – when it happens and for how long
- **Location** – physical room or video link
- **Participants & owner** – who is invited and who’s responsible
- **Associations** – links to teams, initiatives, and objectives

You can create:

- **One‑time meetings** for ad‑hoc discussions
- **Recurring meetings** for rituals (e.g. weekly team syncs, retros, initiative check‑ins)

---

## Why Meetings in mpath Matter (Benefits)

- **Keep conversation and execution connected**  
  Link meetings directly to initiatives and tasks so decisions actually turn into work.

- **Create reliable operating rhythms**  
  Weekly/bi‑weekly/monthly meetings are easy to manage as a series with individual instances.

- **Make ownership and attendance explicit**  
  See who owns the meeting and who is expected to participate.

- **Improve preparation and follow‑through**  
  Notes, associations, and participant status all live in one place.

## Key Concepts

### Meeting

The **definition** of a recurring or one‑time session:

- Title, description, schedule, duration, location
- Default participants and meeting owner
- Recurrence pattern (for series)
- Associations to initiatives, objectives, and teams

### Recurrence

For recurring meetings, you define:

- **Pattern** – daily, weekly, monthly, bi‑monthly, semi‑annually
- **Date range** – start and end dates for the series
- **Defaults** – participants, owner, and base details for all instances

mpath then generates **meeting instances** you can manage individually.

### Participants & Status

Participants have a **response** at the meeting level:

- \`invited\`, \`accepted\`, \`declined\`, \`tentative\`

This helps you see who is expected and who has opted out.

## How to Use Meetings (Step‑by‑Step)

### 1. Create a meeting

1. Go to the **Meetings** area.
2. Click **New meeting**.
3. Fill out the basics:
   - **Title** – clear and descriptive (e.g. “Weekly Product–Eng Sync”)
   - **Description** – purpose, agenda, or context
   - **Date & time** – when the first session happens
   - **Duration** – in minutes
   - **Location** – video link or room
4. Add participants from your organization (and external guests if needed).
5. Set the **meeting owner** – the person responsible for the session.

### 2. Make it recurring (if applicable)

1. Enable **recurrence** if this is a recurring meeting.
2. Choose a pattern (e.g. weekly) and **start/end dates**.
3. Save – mpath will generate **meeting instances** for each occurrence.

### 3. Connect meetings to real work

1. From the meeting page, **associate**:
   - Relevant **teams**  
   - **Initiatives** and **objectives** being discussed
2. Use these associations to:
   - Jump from a meeting to the initiative it supports
   - Quickly find all meetings linked to a strategic effort

### 4. Prepare and run the session

Before the meeting:

- Share or refine the agenda in the **description** or notes.
- Confirm participants and time zones, especially for distributed teams.

During the meeting:

- Capture key points, decisions, and action items in the **meeting instance** notes.
- Use initiatives and tasks as the backbone of the conversation.

## Examples & Best Practices

### Example: Weekly team sync

- **Meeting**: “Weekly Platform Team Sync”
- **Recurrence**: Weekly, 45 minutes
- **Associations**: Platform initiatives and supporting objectives
- **Usage**:
  - Review status of initiatives
  - Scan Blocked/High tasks first
  - Capture new action items as tasks linked to the relevant initiatives

### Example: Monthly initiative review

- **Meeting**: “Monthly Q3 Initiative Review”
- **Participants**: EMs, PMs, key stakeholders
- **Associations**: All Q3 initiatives
- **Usage**:
  - Use initiative pages as the agenda backbone
  - Update RAG and confidence as part of the meeting
  - Create follow‑up tasks for risks and decisions

### General best practices

- **Keep meetings scoped** – each meeting should have a clear purpose and owner.
- **Default to shorter durations** – extend only when it consistently feels too tight.
- **Invite only necessary participants** – avoid bloated meetings when a smaller group would do.
- **Review the series regularly** – cancel or adjust recurring meetings that no longer serve a clear purpose.
