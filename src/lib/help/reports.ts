# Reports

Reports in mpath help you **step back from the day‑to‑day and see patterns** – across people, initiatives, and time.

Use them when you want to answer questions like:

- “What has this person actually been working on this quarter?”
- “Where is our team spending most of its energy?”
- “What stories can I bring into reviews and planning?”

---

## Overview

Reports are **on‑demand analyses** that pull together data from:

- Tasks and initiatives
- Meetings and 1:1s
- Feedback campaigns
- Integrations like GitHub and Jira

They produce **readable summaries** you can use in:

- Performance reviews and calibrations
- Weekly or monthly team health reviews
- Project and initiative updates

## Which Report Should I Use?

### Person Overview Report

Best when you want a **data‑rich view of someone’s work** over a period:

- What tasks they completed and how work flowed.
- Which initiatives and objectives they contributed to.
- GitHub/Jira activity (when linked).
- Optional inclusion of structured feedback.

Use it for:

- Preparing for reviews or promotion discussions.
- Understanding workload and contribution patterns.
- Looking at trends across a quarter or half.

### AI Synopsis Report

Best when you want a **manager‑ready summary in bullet form**:

- 5–8 concise bullets describing key achievements and themes.
- Same underlying data sources as the person overview.

Use it for:

- Quick briefings before 1:1s or leadership meetings.
- Drafting summaries in performance reviews.
- Sharing highlights with stakeholders.

---

## How Reports Fit with the Rest of mpath

Reports rely on:

- **Good task hygiene** (status, priority, initiative links).
- **Accurate initiative ownership** and status.
- **Connected integrations** (GitHub/Jira) where applicable.
- **Feedback campaigns** for richer context.

They don’t replace:

- Day‑to‑day boards or lists.
- 1:1 notes or initiative detail pages.

Instead, they give you a **zoomed‑out view** you can use to:

- Spot patterns.
- Tell coherent stories about impact.
- Plan what to do next.

---

## Access and Permissions (High Level)

In general:

- You can generate **reports about yourself**, provided your account is linked to your person record.
- **Managers** can generate reports about their direct reports (where defined).
- **Admins** can generate reports for anyone in the organization.

All reports respect:

- Organization isolation – no cross‑org visibility.
- Feedback privacy rules – private feedback remains visible only to authors.

For more detail on specific access rules, see the individual report topics.

## Using Reports Effectively

### Before performance reviews

- Generate **Person Overview** and/or **AI Synopsis** for each report.
- Combine with:
  - Feedback campaign results.
  - Your own observations and 1:1 notes.
  - Initiative pages showing broader impact.

### During regular rhythms

- Monthly or quarterly:
  - Run reports for team members or key roles.
  - Look for:
    - Over/under‑utilization.
    - Concentration of risk or critical work.
    - Emerging leaders and high‑impact contributors.

### When communicating upwards

- Use key excerpts and metrics from reports in:
  - Org updates.
  - Project status summaries.
  - Headcount and capacity discussions.
