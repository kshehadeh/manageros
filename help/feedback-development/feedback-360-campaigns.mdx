<Info>
  360-degree feedback campaigns help you **collect comprehensive, multi-source
  feedback from managers, peers, and direct reports** – providing a balanced
  perspective on individual performance and behavior.
</Info>

360-degree feedback campaigns provide a structured way to collect comprehensive feedback from multiple sources about team members, enabling thorough performance evaluations, promotion readiness assessments, and behavioral feedback.

Used well, they turn scattered opinions into actionable insights for growth and development.

## Overview

A 360-degree feedback campaign in mpath is a **focused cycle of feedback about a specific person** from multiple perspectives:

- You choose **who** the feedback is about.
- You choose **who** should respond (managers, peers, direct reports, stakeholders).
- You choose **what** to ask (via templates and questions).
- mpath handles **distribution, collection, and tracking**.

## Why 360-Degree Feedback Matters

<Tip>
  **Richer, multi-source perspective** See how someone shows up for their
  manager, peers, and reports – not just one direction. This provides a more
  complete picture than single-source feedback.
</Tip>

- **More objective performance decisions**  
  Calibrations and promotions can be grounded in broad input, not only hallway opinions.

- **Balanced perspective on individual contributions**  
  Multi-source evaluation from peers, managers, and direct reports provides comprehensive performance and behavior assessment.

- **Reusable, consistent formats**  
  Templates keep your evaluation criteria consistent across time and people.

## When to Use 360-Degree Feedback

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Promotion Readiness Checks">

Use for:

- Assessing readiness for advancement
- Evaluating leadership capabilities
- Understanding impact across the organization

You'll typically invite:

- Manager(s)
- Peers and cross-functional partners
- Direct reports (if applicable)
- Key stakeholders

<Check>
  Promotion decisions benefit from multi-source feedback because they require
  understanding how someone performs across different relationships and
  contexts.
</Check>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Role Transitions">

Use for:

- New manager onboarding
- Leadership role changes
- Cross-functional moves

These help assess:

- How the person is adapting to new responsibilities
- Areas where support is needed
- Strengths to leverage in the new role

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Behavioral and Collaboration Feedback">

Use for:

- Understanding how someone collaborates
- Assessing communication effectiveness
- Identifying development opportunities

This type of feedback is especially valuable because collaboration and communication are best observed by those who work directly with the person.

## How to Run a 360-Degree Feedback Campaign

<Steps>
<Step title="Decide the purpose and audience">

Before you create anything in the UI, answer:

- "What decision will this feedback inform?"
- "Who needs to receive feedback?"
- "Who should be invited to give it?"

This keeps your campaign focused and respectful of people's time.

<Tip>
  **Clear purpose drives better responses** When respondents understand why
  their feedback matters and how it will be used, they're more likely to provide
  thoughtful, detailed responses.
</Tip>

</Step>

<Step title="Create the campaign">

1. Go to **Feedback → Campaigns**.
2. Click **New campaign**.
3. Configure:
   - **Name** – clear and specific (e.g. "Q3 360 – Staff Engineer Candidates").
   - **Target person** – who the feedback will be about.
   - **Template** – choose a pre-built one or customize your own.
   - **Date range** – open and close dates for responses.
   - **Status** – start in `draft` while you review.

</Step>

<Step title="Select participants">

1. Add feedback providers:
   - Manager(s)
   - Peers and partners
   - Direct reports or other stakeholders as needed
2. Ensure a **balanced mix**:
   - Manager(s)
   - Peers and cross-functional partners
   - Direct reports
   - External stakeholders (when relevant)
3. Decide on **anonymity**:
   - Fully anonymous for sensitive or broad feedback (recommended for 360s).
   - Identified when you want explicit accountability and follow-up.

<Warning>
  **Anonymity is typically recommended for 360s** Anonymous responses typically
  yield more candid and useful feedback. However, consider your organization's
  culture and the specific context when making this decision.
</Warning>

</Step>

<Step title="Launch and monitor">

1. Activate the campaign and (optionally) send invites.
2. Use the campaign page to:
   - Track who has responded.
   - Send **reminders** to non-responders.
   - Adjust the end date if you need more time.

</Step>

<Step title="Review and act on results">

Once enough responses are in:

1. Review summaries and individual answers.
2. Look for:
   - Consistent themes across respondents.
   - Differences between groups (e.g. peers vs. reports).
   - Concrete examples to use in coaching or decisions.
3. Turn insights into:
   - **Development plans** and specific goals.
   - Updates to responsibilities or support.
   - Context for performance reviews and promotion discussions.

Share appropriate parts of the feedback with the recipient and agree on next steps.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Setting Up Effective Campaigns

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Basic configuration">

When creating or editing a campaign you can set:

- **Campaign name** – descriptive title for the feedback cycle.
- **Target person** – the individual receiving feedback.
- **Template** – pre-defined or custom question sets.
- **Date range** – start and end dates for responses.
- **Status** – `draft`, `active`, `completed`, or `cancelled`.

Good defaults:

- Start in **Draft** while you confirm participants and questions.
- Move to **Active** once you're ready to send invites.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Managing participants">

You control who is invited to respond:

- Add an **invite list** of feedback providers.
- Use **roles** to ensure a balanced mix:
  - Manager(s)
  - Peers and cross-functional partners
  - Direct reports
  - External stakeholders (when relevant)
- Decide if responses should be **anonymous** or identified.

<Tip>
  **Balanced participant mix** Aim for a mix of perspectives. Too many managers
  or too many peers can skew the results. A balanced mix provides a more
  accurate picture.
</Tip>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Using templates">

Templates help you:

- Reuse consistent **question sets** across cycles.
- Mix **rating scales** with open-ended questions.
- Tailor questions to:
  - 360-degree feedback

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Collecting Responses

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Invitations and reminders">

For each campaign you can:

- Send **initial invite emails** with secure links to the form.
- Send **reminder emails** to non-responders while the campaign is active.
- See, for each invitee:
  - When invites and reminders were sent.
  - Whether they have submitted a response.

Tips:

- Time invites so people have space to respond thoughtfully.
- Use 1–2 reminders, not continual nudges.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Email Notifications">

Feedback campaigns support optional email notifications to help increase response rates:

- **Initial Invites**: Send invitation emails to all participants when the campaign is created or activated
  - Only available for draft or active campaigns
  - Can only be sent once per campaign
  - Includes campaign details, target person name, and feedback link
- **Reminder Emails**: Send follow-up reminders to participants who haven't responded
  - Only available for active campaigns
  - Automatically filters out participants who have already responded
  - Can be sent multiple times as needed
  - Includes days remaining information when applicable

- **Email Status Tracking**: View when emails were sent to each participant
  - See invite sent dates in the invitee list
  - Track reminder history for each participant
  - Monitor email delivery status

To send emails:

1. Navigate to the campaign detail page
2. Find the "Email Notifications" section
3. Click "Send Invites" to send initial invitations (if not already sent)
4. Click "Send Reminder" to send reminders to non-responders (for active campaigns)

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The response experience">

- A **user-friendly**, mobile-friendly form.
- Progress indicators for longer surveys.
- Clear messaging about whether responses are **anonymous**.

Encourage:

- **Specific examples** instead of vague statements.
- A **balanced view** (strengths and growth areas).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Managing responses">

As responses come in you can:

- Track completion in real time.
- Prevent duplicates (one response per invite).
- Handle anonymous responses appropriately.

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Analyzing Feedback

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What data is captured">

Behind the scenes, responses include:

- Ratings and text answers to each question.
- **Timestamps** and metadata.
- Participant identity (when not anonymous).
- Campaign and target person context.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How to read the results">

Use the campaign detail views to:

- Look at **rating distributions** and averages.
- Review **open-ended comments** for patterns.
- Compare themes across respondent groups (e.g. peers vs. reports).

When synthesizing:

- Focus on **recurring themes**, not single comments.
- Separate:
  - Observations about **impact and behavior**.
  - Suggestions about **style or preferences**.
- Capture 3–5 key strengths and 2–3 focus areas.

<Tip>
  **Look for patterns, not outliers** One negative comment among many positive
  ones might be an outlier. Focus on themes that appear consistently across
  multiple respondents.
</Tip>

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Privacy, Security, and Trust

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Data protection">

Feedback data is:

- Stored securely with **encryption**.
- Governed by **role-based access** controls.
- Tracked via **audit trails** where required.

Campaigns should be designed in line with your org's privacy and HR policies.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Anonymity">

When you enable anonymity:

- Individual responses are **de-identified** in views shared with the recipient.
- Reports may use **aggregated** data and minimum response thresholds.
- You should avoid sharing highly identifying quotes without care.

<Tip>
  **Anonymous responses encourage honesty** For 360-degree feedback, anonymous
  responses typically yield more candid and useful feedback. People are more
  likely to be honest when they don't fear repercussions.
</Tip>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Compliance">

mpath supports:

- Data minimization and retention practices.
- Rights to deletion and access where required (e.g. GDPR contexts).

Always check with your HR/legal partners for org-specific requirements.

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## From Responses to Action

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Designing follow-up">

After a campaign closes:

1. Summarize themes for each recipient.
2. Share the summary in a **1:1 or performance conversation**.
3. Co-create:
   - 1–3 focus areas.
   - Concrete actions and support.
   - Timeframes for revisiting progress.

<Check>
  **Close the loop** Sharing feedback themes and intended actions with
  recipients is critical. Without follow-up, feedback campaigns lose their
  value.
</Check>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Integrating with other systems">

Feedback results can inform:

- **Performance reviews** and calibration.
- **Goal setting** and development plans.
- **Succession and promotion** decisions.
- **Team-level interventions** (training, coaching, process changes).

Use feedback as _one input_ alongside:

- Outcomes and impact (initiatives, tasks).
- Your own observations.
- Synopses and reports.

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Examples & Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Example: 360 ahead of a Staff promotion">

- Target: Senior Engineer being considered for Staff.
- Invitees: Manager, tech leads, key peers, direct reports.
- Questions:
  - Impact on initiatives.
  - Technical leadership and collaboration.
  - Where they should focus next to succeed at Staff.
- Outcome:
  - Rich, structured input to bring into promotion discussions.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Quick best practices">

- **Be clear about purpose** – tell respondents how their input will be used.
- **Ask for examples**, not just ratings – examples make feedback actionable.
- **Close the loop** – share themes and intended actions with recipients.
- **Use anonymity** – anonymous responses typically yield more honest feedback for 360s.
- **Don't over-campaign** – focus on a few high-value cycles instead of constant surveys.

<Tip>
  **Quality over quantity** A few well-run campaigns that lead to action are far
  more valuable than many campaigns that are ignored or forgotten.
</Tip>

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="If response rates are low">

- Re-check:
  - Timing (avoid peak load periods).
  - Length and complexity of the survey.
  - How clearly you communicated **why** the feedback matters.

<Tip>
  **Response rates improve with clear communication** When people understand the
  purpose and importance of the feedback, they're more likely to participate.
  Take time to explain why their input matters.
</Tip>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="If responses are low quality">

- Adjust templates to:
  - Ask for **examples**.
  - Focus on **specific situations**.
  - Reduce overly generic questions.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Quick best practices">

- **Be transparent** – tell people how feedback will be used and who will see it.
- **Close the loop** – share themes and actions with both recipients and, when appropriate, respondents.
- **Use campaigns sparingly but meaningfully** – a few well-run campaigns beat constant noise.

<Warning>
  **Campaign fatigue is real** Too many feedback campaigns can lead to low
  response rates and poor quality responses. Be selective about when and why you
  run campaigns.
</Warning>
