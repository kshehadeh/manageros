## Entity Notes

Entity notes are attached to specific entities in mpath:

4. Enter your note content (supports markdown)
5. Optionally attach files or embed images

- Save to update the note
- The note will show when it was last updated

<Warning>
  Only the note creator or organization admins can edit notes. Make sure to capture important information correctly the first time.

Standalone notes are independent notes with titles that exist on their own. They're perfect for:

- Team guides and resources

### Creating Standalone Notes

- Useful for team-specific documentation

**Shared with everyone:**

</Tip>

2. Or paste an image from your clipboard

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Use entity notes for context**  
  Attach notes directly to initiatives, tasks, or meetings to keep context where it's needed. This makes information easy to find.
</Tip>

- **Use standalone notes for documentation**  
  Create standalone notes for wikis, guides, or general knowledge that doesn't belong to a specific entity.

- **Keep notes focused**  
  Each note should cover a single topic or decision. This makes notes easier to find and maintain.

- **Use descriptive titles**  
  For standalone notes, use clear, descriptive titles that make them easy to find and understand.

- **Share appropriately**  
  Use sharing settings to control access. Private notes for personal use, shared notes for team documentation.

- **Update notes regularly**  
  Keep notes current. Outdated documentation can be worse than no documentation.

- **Link related notes**  
  Use markdown links to connect related notes and create a knowledge network.
