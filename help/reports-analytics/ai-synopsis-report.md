# AI Synopsis Report

The AI Synopsis Report is a **report wrapper around synopsis generation** – it packages an AI‑written summary of a person’s work into a shareable report instance.

It’s ideal when you want a **short, manager‑ready view** that you can store, link, and revisit later.

---

## When to Use the AI Synopsis Report

Use this report when:

- You need a **concise summary** for a review, promotion doc, or leadership update.
- You’re preparing for a **1:1** and want fast context on recent work.
- You’re reviewing **multiple people at once** and want consistent formatting.

Pair it with:

- `person-overview-report` for deep data and breakdowns.
- `synopsis-generation` to understand how synopses work more broadly.

## What’s in the Report

An AI Synopsis Report typically includes:

- **Header** – person name, role, and date range.
- **AI synopsis** – 5–8 bullets summarizing:
  - Key initiatives and projects.
  - Notable tasks and outcomes.
  - Patterns in GitHub/Jira activity (if connected).
  - Any major shifts or highlights.
- **Data sources** – which systems contributed (tasks, initiatives, GitHub, Jira, feedback).
- **Data summary** – high‑level counts (tasks, PRs, tickets, etc.).

It uses the same underlying data as synopses, but frames it as a **report instance** you can open from the Reports area.

## How to Run the Report

1. Go to the **Reports** section.
2. Choose **Person AI Synopsis**.
3. Configure:
   - **Person** – whose work you’re summarizing.
   - **From / To dates** – the time window you care about.
   - **Include feedback** – whether to blend in structured feedback data.
4. Run the report and open the generated instance to review or copy the synopsis.

Use shorter windows (1–4 weeks) for **check‑ins** and longer windows for **reviews**.

## How to Use the Output

### In reviews and performance docs

- Paste the synopsis into:
  - Draft performance reviews (then adjust wording and add your own voice).
  - Calibration materials as a quick “headline view”.
- Cross‑check with:
  - The Person Overview report.
  - Feedback campaign outputs.
  - Your own notes and observations.

### In 1:1s and leadership updates

- Skim the synopsis just before the meeting:
  - Recall major achievements and initiatives.
  - Spot load patterns (e.g. heavy incident work vs. project work).
- Use it to:
  - Frame questions (“I noticed… tell me more about…”).
  - Anchor praise and coaching in concrete recent work.

## Access Summary

- **Self** – people can generate AI Synopsis reports for themselves.
- **Admins** – can generate them for anyone in the organization.

All usual organization and feedback privacy rules apply:

- No cross‑org visibility.
- Private feedback is only surfaced where the viewer has rights to see it.

Always treat the AI synopsis as a **draft**:

- Verify accuracy.
- Adjust tone for your context.
- Use it as scaffolding, not a final verdict.
