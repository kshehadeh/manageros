Meeting instances are the individual occurrences of a recurring meeting series. Each instance tracks its own timing, notes, and attendance.

## Manage an instance

- **Schedule**: Adjust the specific date/time if this occurrence shifts
- **Notes**: Capture outcomes, decisions, and action items
- **Participants**: Add/remove participants for this instance only
- **Statuses**: invited, accepted, declined, tentative
- **Attendance**: attended, absent, excused

## Editing instances vs the series

- Edit the series to change the pattern, participants, or defaults going forward
- Edit an instance to change a single occurrence without impacting the series

## Action items

- Create tasks from instance notes and link them back for context
- Assign responsibilities and due dates to ensure follow‑through

## Tips

- Keep notes concise and decision‑oriented
- Record attendance promptly after the meeting
- Cancel instances that are no longer needed to keep calendars clean

## Common issues

- If an instance is missing, verify the series date range and recurrence
- If participants don’t appear, confirm they were added to the series or instance
